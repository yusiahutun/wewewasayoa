If we are unable to accept your order, we will inform you of this and will not charge you for the product. This might be because the product is out of stock, because of unexpected limits on our resources which we could not reasonably plan for, because we have identified an error in the price or description of the product or because we are unable to meet a delivery deadline you have specified.</p><p>3.3 Your order number.

The usual situation is that products will be shipped within two weeks of the end of the relevant campaign.</p><p>7.3 We are not responsible for delays outside our control.

If you do not give us this information within a reasonable time of us asking for it, or if you give us incomplete or incorrect information, we may either end the contract (and clause 10.2 will apply) or make an additional charge of a reasonable sum to compensate us for any extra work that is required as a result. We will not be responsible for supplying the products late or not supplying any part of them if this is caused by you not giving us the information, we need within a reasonable time of us asking for it.</p><p>7.9 Reasons we may suspend the supply of products to you.

If you do not pay us for the products when you are supposed to for any reason (see clause 12.4).</p><p id=e8BnDYDUlINi data-wc=619>8. Your rights to end the contract</p><p>8.1 You may end your contract with us. Your rights when you end the contract will depend on what you have bought, whether there is anything wrong with it, how we are performing and when you decide to end the contract:</p><p>8.1.1 If what you have bought is faulty or misdescribed you may have a legal right to end the contract (or to get the product repaired or replaced or to get some or all your money back), see clause 11.</p><p>8.1.2 If you want to end the contract because of something we have done or have told you we are going to do, see clause 8.2.</p><p>8.1.3 If you have just changed your mind about the product, see clause 8.3. You may be able to get a refund if you are within the cooling-off period, but this may be subject to deductions, and you may have to pay the costs of return of any goods.</p><p>8.1.4 In all other cases (if we are not at fault and there is no right to change your mind), see clause 8.4.</p><p>8.2 Ending the contract because of something we have done or are going to do. If you are ending a contract for a reason set out at (a) to (e) below the contract will end immediately and we will refund you in full for any products which have not been provided and you may also be entitled to compensation. The reasons are:</p><p>8.2.1 we have told you about an upcoming change to the product or these terms which you do not agree to (see clause 6.2).</p><p>8.2.2 we have told you about an error in the price or description of the product you have ordered, and you do not wish to proceed.</p><p>8.2.3 there is a risk that supply of the products may be significantly delayed because of events outside our control.</p><p>8.2.4 we have suspended supply of the products for technical reasons, or notify you we are going to suspend them for technical reasons, in each case for a period of more than 60 days, or</p><p>8.2.5 you have a legal right to end the contract because of something we have done wrong.</p><p>8.3 Exercising your right to change your mind (Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013). For most products bought online you have a legal right to change your mind within 14 days and receive a refund. However, please note that you do not have a right to change your mind in respect of Products that are made to your specifications or are clearly personalized (regulation 28(1)(b), Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013). You acknowledge that if you cancel the contract in circumstances where the right to change your mind does not apply, you must pay us reasonable compensation for the net costs we will incur as a result of your cancellation.</p><p>8.4 Ending the contract where we are not at fault and there is no right to change your mind. Even if we are not at fault and you do not have a right to change your mind (see clause 8.1), you can still end the contract before it is completed, but you may have to pay us compensation. A contract for goods is completed when the product is delivered and paid for. If you want to end a contract before it is completed where we are not at fault and you have not changed your mind, just contact us to let us know. The contract will end immediately, and we will refund any sums paid by you for products not provided but we may deduct from that refund (or, if you have not made an advance payment, charge you reasonable compensation for the net costs we will incur as a result of your ending the contract.</p><p id=exDFI09vZP7o data-wc=582>9.

We will pay the costs of return:</p><p>9.3.1 if the products are faulty or misdescribed.</p><p>9.3.2 if you are ending the contract because we have told you of an upcoming change to the product or these terms, an error in pricing or description, a delay in delivery due to events outside our control or because you have a legal right to do so as a result of something we have done wrong; or In all other circumstances, including where you are exercising your right to change your mind, you must pay the costs of return.</p><p>9.4 What we charge for collection. If you are responsible for the costs of return and we are collecting the product from you, we will charge you the direct cost to us of collection. The costs of collection will be the same as our charges for standard delivery.</p><p>9.5 How we will refund you. We will refund you the price you paid for the products including delivery costs, by the method you used for payment. However, we may make deductions from the price, as described below.</p><p>9.6 Deductions from refunds if you are exercising your right to change your mind. If you are exercising your right to change your mind:</p><p>9.6.1 We may reduce your refund of the price (excluding delivery costs) to reflect any reduction in the value of the goods if this has been caused by your handling them in a way which would not be permitted in a shop. If we refund you the price paid before we are able to inspect the goods and later discover you have handled them in an unacceptable way, you must pay us an appropriate amount.</p><p>9.6.2 The maximum refund for delivery costs will be the costs of delivery by the least expensive delivery method we offer. For example, if we offer delivery of a product within 3-5 days at one cost but you choose to have the product delivered within 24 hours at a higher cost, then we will only refund what you would have paid for the cheaper delivery option.</p><p>9.7 When your refund will be made. We will make any refunds due to you as soon as possible. If you are exercising your right to change your mind, then:</p><p>9.7.1 If the products are goods and we have not offered to collect them, your refund will be made within 14 days from the day on which we receive the product back from you or, if earlier, the day on which you provide us with evidence that you have sent the product back to us.</p><p>9.7.2 In all other cases, your refund will be made within 14 days of your telling us you have changed your mind</p><p id=eDjQMxW-aLdv data-wc=229>10. Our rights to end the contract</p><p>10.1 We may end the contract if you break it. We may end the contract for a product at any time by writing to you if:</p><p>10.1.1 you do not make any payment to us when it is due, and you still do not make payment within 14 days of us reminding you that payment is due;</p><p>10.1.2 you do not, within a reasonable time of us asking for it, provide us with information that is necessary for us to provide the products.</p><p>10.1.3 you do not, within a reasonable time, allow us to deliver the products to you or collect them from us.</p><p>10.2 You must compensate us if you break the contract. If we end the contract in the situations set out in clause 10.1 we will refund any money you have paid in advance for products we have not provided but we may deduct or charge you reasonable compensation for the net costs we will incur as a result of your breaking the contract.</p><p>10.3 We may withdraw the product. We may write to you to let you know that we are going to stop providing the product. We will let you know as far as reasonably possible in advance of our stopping the supply of the product and will refund any sums you have paid in advance for products which will not be provided.</p><p id=eyGrpNhz3bb1 data-wc=90>11. If there is a problem with the product</p><p>11.1 How to tell us about problems. We are under a legal duty to supply products that are in conformity with this contract.

We will pay the costs of postage and can provide a return label.</p><p id=ehHPiCKSDOL9 data-wc=295>12. Price and payment</p><p>12.1 Where to find the price for the product. The price of the product (which includes VAT) will be the price indicated on the order pages when you placed your order. We take all reasonable care to ensure that the price of the product advised to you is correct. However please see clause 12.3 for what happens if we discover an error in the price of the product you order.</p><p>12.2 We will pass on changes in the rate of VAT. If the rate of VAT changes between your order date and the date we supply the product, we will adjust the rate of VAT that you pay, unless you have already paid for the product in full before the change in the rate of VAT takes effect.</p><p>12.3 What happens if we got the price wrong. It is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the products we sell may be incorrectly priced. We will normally check prices before accepting your order so that, where the product's correct price at your order date is less than our stated price at your order date, we will charge the lower amount. If the product's correct price at your order date is higher than the price stated to you, we will contact you for your instructions before we accept your order.</p><p>12.4 When you must pay and how you must pay. You must pay for the products before we dispatch them. Your payment card will be charged at the time when you place the order.</p><p>12.5 Delivery charges: the price of a product does not include delivery charges. The delivery charges are as quoted on our website from time to time. Relevant delivery charges are provided when you select an order for purchase, at the check-out.</p><p id=eLilAzSS6lsD data-wc=275>13. Our responsibility for loss or damage suffered by you</p><p>13.1 We are responsible to you for foreseeable loss and damage caused by us. If we fail to comply with these terms, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking this contract or our failing to use reasonable care and skill, but we are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time the contract was made, both we and you knew it might happen, for example, if you discussed it with us during the sales process.</p><p>13.2 We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so. This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors; for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; for breach of your legal rights in relation to the products including the right to receive products which are: as described and match information we provided to you and any sample or model seen or examined by you; of satisfactory quality; and fit for any particular purpose made known to us; and for defective products under the Consumer Protection Act 1987</p><p>13.3 We are not liable for business losses. We only supply the products for domestic and private use. If you use the products for any commercial, business or re-sale purpose we will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.</p><p id=eH4J90RGip9 data-wc=29>14. How we may use your personal information</p><p>14.1 How we may use your personal information. We will only use your personal information as set out in our <a class=hm-link href=#>Privacy policy</a>.</p><p id=eV1kUsFf18wh data-wc=420>15. Other important terms</p><p>15.1 We may transfer this agreement to someone else. We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to another organization. We will contact you to let you know if we plan to do this. If you are unhappy with the transfer, you may contact us to end the contract within 14 days of us telling you about it and we will refund you any payments you have made in advance for products not provided.</p><p>15.2 You need our consent to transfer your rights to someone else (except that you can always transfer our guarantee). You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these terms to another person if we agree to this in writing.</p><p>15.3 Nobody else has any rights under this contract (except someone you pass your guarantee on to). This contract is between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms. Neither of us will need to get the agreement of any other person in order to end the contract or make any changes to these terms.</p><p>15.4 If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will continue in force. Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.</p><p>15.5 Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date. For example, if you miss a payment and we do not chase you, but we continue to provide the products, we can still require you to make the payment at a later date.</p><p>15.6 Which laws apply to this contract and where you may bring legal proceedings.
