Divine interventions are underway, speeding you up toward the inevitable and laying down the groundwork for what comes next. And yet, the cosmos still aren’t finished reconstructing your life, because this could be the most innovative week of 2024.</p><p>A <a href=#>first quarter moon</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#> in Cancer</a> on April 15 guides us through the beginning of the week, fully immersing you in your emotions and encouraging you to take action. You may have had many revelations and insights last week, and now, you’re moving toward new goals and deepening your dedication to ongoing engagements. Take your time! It may be Aries season, but <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Mercury is still retrograde</a>, forcing us to take things slow and tie off loose ends from the past.</p><p>Toward the end of the week, you may have heartfelt conversations with loved ones and find closure in your relationships. On April 19, Mercury retrograde will join forces <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>with Venus in Aries</a>, paving the way for passionate declarations that reveal where everyone stands. People will be admitting that they never stopped loving each other; that their feelings have never faded.</p><p>As Mars in Pisces forms a sextile to both <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>expansive Jupiter</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>enlightening Uranus</a> on the same day, you may feel equally motivated to take action toward something exciting, inventive, and somewhat shocking. April 19 is also when the sun enters Taurus, getting us grounded and allowing our commitments to take root. Taurus season is when longterm visions really start taking shape, inspiring patience, pragmatism, and practicality. But let’s not forget that Taurus is ruled by Venus, encouraging us to find pleasure, sensuality, and indulgence every step of the way.</p><p>All of this culminates to one of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the most significant astrological events of 2024</a>—the Jupiter-Uranus conjunction at 21 degrees Taurus. Taking place on April 20, this conjunction represents the rumblings of collective change, spearheading us toward an unknowable future. Longstanding structures are being torn down, outdated attitudes are being tested, and a brand new world awaits us on the other side of this journey. Get ready for shocks and surprises to pave the way for massive breakthroughs. The future is now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-the-planets-will-affect-your-zodiac-sign-this-week>How the Planets Will Affect Your Zodiac Sign This Week</h2><p>Here’s what you can expect from the upcoming week, according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>your sun</a> and/or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising&nbsp;sign</a>&nbsp;(and seriously, you’re missing out if you don’t read these horoscopes for your rising sign):</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8.2332782824112><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zodiacbannerday_aries.png><p>You’re reconnecting with your roots as this week, as a first quarter moon lights a fire in your fourth house of home and family on April 15.
