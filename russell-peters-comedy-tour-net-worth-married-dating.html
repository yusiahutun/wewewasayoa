And his next show will be in Dubai at Cova-Cola Arena, where he will deliver his hilarious takes on cancel culture, aging, and the current state of the world. Russell Peter had performed in Abu Dhabi at Etihad Arena back in September 2021, so his show in March will be his comeback for his Dubai fans.</span></p><p><span>The Tickets for his Dubai show will start at Dhs 195 and will be available on the Coca-Cola Arena website. Russell Peters is one of the most successful stand-up comedians who has a record of packed out stadiums and arenas, including Madison Square Garden and The Sydney Opera House, and more.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net Worth Of Russell Peters</span></strong></h2><p><span>Russell Peters has a net worth of $75 million as a comedian, actor, and entertainer from Canada. He became one of the top ten highest-earning comedians in 2009 when he earned $10 million for his performance. His highest record was $21 million in income in 2013, but that decreased to an estimated $19 million in 2015.</span></p><p><span>Russell Peters was born in 1970 as Russell Dominic Peters in Toronto, and he attended Chinguacousy Secondary School in Bramalea, where he was bullied for his Indian ethnicity. He started his career in 1989 and performed in various countries. His turning point was his performance on the Canadian TV comedy show Comedy Now! that became viral in 2004.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>He became the first comedian to sell-out Toronto's Air Canada Centre selling more than 16,000 tickets in two days for a single show in 2007.
