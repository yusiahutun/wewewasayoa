Joey Diaz has appeared in numerous films and television series. His big-screen credits include "Analyze That," "The Longest Yard," and "The Many Saints of Newark," while his notable credits on the small screen include the sitcom "My Name is Earl." Diaz is also known for his many appearances on the podcast "The <a href=#>Joe Rogan</a> Experience," as well as for hosting his own podcasts "The Church of What's Happening Now" and "Uncle Joey's Joint."</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Joey Diaz was born on February 19, 1963 in Havana, Cuba and was raised in North Bergen, New Jersey. There, his mother ran a bar and a numbers racket. When Diaz was three, his father passed away; his mother later died when he was 16. He was subsequently taken in by a number of families, with his reckless behavior keeping him from settling down in one place for long. During this period, Diaz started taking drugs and committing crimes. Despite his delinquency, he did well in school at North Bergen High School, winning performing arts awards and graduating in 1982. He then moved to Colorado, where he became homesick. This prompted a return to New Jersey. However, Diaz moved back to Colorado in 1985 to attend the University of Colorado at Boulder. Unhappy there, he ultimately dropped out of the school.</p><h2 id=prison-time><strong>Prison Time</strong></h2><p>In 1988, Diaz was sentenced to four years in prison for kidnapping and aggravated robbery. While incarcerated, he performed stand-up comedy routines for his fellow inmates, fueling his passion for launching a stand-up career. Diaz was released from prison after serving 16 months of his sentence.</p><h2 id=stand-up-comedy-career><strong>Stand-up Comedy Career</strong></h2><p>After taking a course in stand-up comedy, Diaz made his professional stand-up debut in June of 1991 at the Comedy Works in Denver, Colorado. During this period of his life, he was still struggling with a cocaine addiction, a problem that led to a disaster of a set in 1992. Diaz subsequently swore off taking the substance before performances. Continuing to develop his act, he won a few amateur comedy competitions. In 1995, Diaz relocated to Los Angeles to take his career to the next level. He found steady success over the ensuing years, and released a number of stand-up comedy specials.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-252987 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/GettyImages-457218753.jpg alt="Joey Diaz Net Worth" width=417 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-252987 class=wp-caption-text>Getty Images</p><h2 id=film-career><strong>Film Career</strong></h2><p>In the late 90s, Diaz made the transition to acting.
