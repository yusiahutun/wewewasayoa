His father Carmelo Iriarte who died of cancer when he was only two years old was Puerto Rican and his mother Mary Anthony is African-American. When Anthony turned 8 his family moved to Baltimore. It was there that the young athlete was able to develop his basketball skills in the hope of using them as a way out of poverty.</p><p>Anthony first attended Towson Catholic High School in Maryland for three years before being transferred to Oak Hill Academy in Virginia for his final year. During his time in Towson Anthony made a name for himself and was widely considered one of the best players. However, because he was weak and thin the NBA teams did not consider snapping him up which means he had to go to college.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Michael Jordan’s Height, Weight, And Body Measurements</a></strong></p><p>In addition for him to have the chance to attend a good school with a renowned basketball program, he had to have good grades which he didn’t do and that’s why he chose to go to Oak.

During the 2002-2003 season, he averaged 22.2 points and 10.0 rebounds while leading the team in various categories including scoring rebounds and minutes played. At the end of the season, he announced his intention to participate in the 2003 NBA Entry Draft where he was selected by the Denver Nuggets with a 3rd place behind <a href=#><b>LeBron James</b></a> and Darko Milicic.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Carmelo Anthony Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Carmelo Anthony has an estimated net worth of approximately $120 million. As one of only three NBA players with a non-commercial clause, he has been able to amass his enormous wealth through contracts over the years in the NBA as well as through the many endorsement contracts he has had with major companies such as Foot Locker Jordan Brand Nike and Nickelodeon.</p><p>In 2010 when Anthony was recruited by the Denver Nuggets he signed a 3-year contract for $10.4 million. At the end of this agreement, he agreed to extend his stay with the Nuggets by signing a brand new five-year agreement worth $80 million in 2006. In 2011 just before he was traded to the New York Knicks Anthony signed a 3-year $64.2 million extension with Denver. After three years as Knick under his previous contract, he wrote a $124.1 million contract over five years to continue his stay at Madison Square Garden.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Family – Wife, Son, Divorce</strong></h2><p>Carmelo Anthony is married to the beautiful Alani Nicole Anthony (née Vazquez) better known by her stage name La La. The couple got engaged on Christmas Day 2004 but finally exchanged vows in July 2010.

The family of three lived together on the Upper West Side of New York until 2017 when it was reported that Ms. Anthony had moved out of their apartment and was living separately. It was also reported that the reason she moved was that her basketball husband had been publicly accused of impregnating another woman.
