A dozen slim, perfectly coiffed and stylishly attired young men gather around the woman who has ordered champagne and begin a carefully choreographed performance designed to make her feel like the most important person in the world. The call-and-response lyrics of the song tell the young lady that she’s a princess and that the attentions of this pack of Prince Charmings is focused entirely on her, which it is, for these few moments at least. In reality, the champagne call, complete with funky dance moves, serves to show appreciation for the minimum of 40,000 yen (HK$2,720) she has just spent.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shangrila is a host club in Tokyo’s Kabukicho red light district, where the young men earn a living by entertaining the female customers and encouraging them to spend big. It was the owner of Shangrila who 15 years ago created the champagne call. It’s now standard at host clubs across Japan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x385/public/images/methode/2016/12/15/cf394d4e-bc48-11e6-b1a9-d0a597083a8f_660x385.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Host clubs are the male counterpart to kaba kura (a Japanese contraction of ‘cabaret club’, where hostesses entertain men) and have grown in both popularity and social acceptance in recent decades. Many see the role of hosts and hostesses as an extension of geisha culture. The performances of hosts may not have the refinement of geisha – ‘gei’ is written with the Chinese character meaning art – but singing and engaging conversational skills are prerequisites, along with the right looks.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">The erotic-party hostess who calls Kuala Lumpur her second home</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As with geisha, the suggestion of sex is more central to the work of hosts than the act itself, though the line is sometimes crossed outside the clubs. For the most part though, it is the egos of customers that are stroked rather than body parts. The role of the hosts is to entertain, compliment and listen to the female customers; to play the perfect boyfriend, albeit one who needs to be bought expensive drinks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x385/public/images/methode/2016/12/15/ed4427a0-bc48-11e6-b1a9-d0a597083a8f_660x385.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The literary Shangri-La was a mystical, Oriental paradise on earth, and host clubs aim to create a fantasy land where attractive and charming young men attend to the every need of female customers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Well, almost every need.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Confessions of a Tokyo bar hostess: ‘I’m not a pure girl any more’</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Women can talk to the types of guys here they don’t meet in everyday life. Guys who take a lot of care over their appearance. Many of them even have plastic surgery,” says Ryo Tachibana, a former host who now manages the business side of Shangrila.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Essentially, they buy the host for that time and make them theirs. Customers often compete with each other to buy more expensive alcohol so they can spend time with a top host.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Host clubs may deal in dreams and illusions, but the real currency is cold, hard cash. Huge photographs of the hosts are displayed outside the clubs, ranked on how much they convinced customers to part with the previous month.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x385/public/images/methode/2016/12/15/c63a32ce-bc4a-11e6-b1a9-d0a597083a8f_660x385.jpg><h4 type=h6 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0">WATCH: I’m not pure any more – Chinese woman tells all about working as a bar hostess in Japan</h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The biggest nights at the clubs are birthdays, not of the clientele, but of the hosts. Women frequently spend eye-watering sums on ‘champagne towers’ (pyramids of glasses theatrically filled with bubbly) of Dom Perignon or bottles of premium cognac for the birthday boy. A bottle of Dom Perignon Rose goes for 250,000 yen at Shangrila, Dom Perignon Gold for a cool 1 million yen and a bottle of Louis XIII de Remy Martin double that.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“One lady spent 4 million yen on a champagne tower on my birthday one year,” recalls Hiro Kousaki, 30, the current No 2 host at Shangrila.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For the most part, hosts are reluctant to discuss their earnings, but Kousaki says he made 8 million yen</p><p>[HK$550,000] during his birthday month.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">‘Act cute, but nothing sexually explicit’: inside the world of China’s online hostesses</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But maintaining a perfect appearance doesn’t come cheap. Kousaki says he spends 100,000 yen a month on hair and make-up alone, while Ryohey Onizuka,、32, the boss at Shangrila, reluctantly admits to spending as much as 1 million yen a month on his appearance, including on his clothes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hosting also takes a physical and psychological toll.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There are times when you get too drunk or your stomach is bloated, so you go to the toilet and throw up so that you can carry on. If you’ve drunk too much you have to make yourself sick quickly before the alcohol gets into your bloodstream,” explains Kousaki.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x385/public/images/methode/2016/12/15/dd77f586-bc48-11e6-b1a9-d0a597083a8f_660x385.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“On a regular night, you drink about 10 bottles of beer. In my first year, I put on 20kg and had to start exercising hard to keep in shape.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In addition to excessive drinking, many hosts become heavy gamblers or compulsive shoppers, according to Tachibana, the manager, who has been in the business for 24 years. But the allure of huge rewards is enough for some to make a career as a host, though one that rarely lasts more than a dozen years. Stories abound of women buying expensive presents for their favoured host, including cars and even apartments.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Chinese hostesses catch Japanese hi-tech executives in honey trap</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Onizuka says the most he has seen spent in one night was 30 million yen by the daughter of a wealthy landowning family. Customers range from businesswomen to housewives to shop assistants who splurge monthly on pay day.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But around 60 per cent of the regulars at Shangrila are from one industry: Japan’s huge sex trade. The hosts don’t, though, talk to the women about their work because they come to forget their daily grind.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They get mentally tired and stressed from that kind of work. And regular guys often look down on them if they find out what they do,” says Onizuka. “But hosts are part of that world so we don’t judge them.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although most of the women come just to blow off steam, that stress can manifest itself in bizarre ways.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x385/public/images/methode/2016/12/15/c3c51bc8-bc48-11e6-b1a9-d0a597083a8f_660x385.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“About 15 years ago, there was a customer who used to spend a lot of money at the club. One night she offered me 300,000 yen to eat fried noodles that she had chewed and then spat out into the high heels she was wearing,” recalls the manager Tachibana. “I ate it. I couldn’t do it now, but I was young and wanted the money.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Working in the sex trade, she had to do whatever customers told her to all day. She came for stress relief and to use the money she earned to make someone do what she said,” says Tachibana.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another dark side of the industry are reports of young women who unknowingly run up huge bills at a club and are then ‘introduced’ to jobs in the sex trade to pay them off. Earlier this year, a 20-year-old woman was pressured to work in a brothel to pay off an 800,000 yen bill from her first visit to a host club in the Tokyo area.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The number of such incidents appears to be on the decline, but it still happens, according to Aiki Segawa, an advocate at Lighthouse, a human-trafficking NGO that helped the victim.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Tachibana, the industry is far cleaner than it was, with very few clubs running scams, restrictions on opening hours, regular police checks, much less yakuza gangster involvement behind the scenes and different kinds of hosts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When I started nearly all of the senior hosts had previously been in bosozoku motorbike gangs or came from yakuza families,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Now it’s different, a lot of regular young guys now host, including many university students who work part time.”</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Hostess clubs close in Hong Kong</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Miyu, a strikingly attractive 23-year-old who says she works “in the entertainment business”, has been coming to host clubs since she was 18. She comes to Shangrila seven or eight times a month, spending an average of 45,000 yen each time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I can forget about my job for a few hours here and go back to work tomorrow refreshed. The hosts listen to what I have to say and can give me straightforward advice about my problems because they don’t really know me. Overall, it’s a plus in my life,” she says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x385/public/images/methode/2016/12/15/0818da94-bc49-11e6-b1a9-d0a597083a8f_660x385.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She has no interest in dating the hosts, as some women do, and says she “enjoys spending money to support the guys I like so that they don’t fall down the rankings”. “The relationship and roles are clear and I’m in the position of power,” she adds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Not all customers are able to view the game so clearly.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Those who understand that we are hosts and what we do are more fun to spend time with.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But if they see us as an individual, want to meet us outside work and start to get feelings for us, then it gets difficult,” says Kousaki, the No 2 host, who does nevertheless go on ‘dates’ with customers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But for all the money spent, compliments given and champagne drunk, Kousaki concedes that hosts are unlikely to truly make any woman’s dreams come true.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I don’t think we truly satisfy them, but we fill a hole in their heart.” <span class="tw_sectioncolor css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1><span class="courier css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0>■</span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZMCwr8ieq7JnkafBqq%2FLnmZraGVogHmFjqKlrKGUmnqrrc%2BapaxlmKTAtXnCpaybq12irq2xjKCcoquYlsBuu9Fmoa6rpGK9s7HTrbBmpZWj</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-japans-host-clubs-male-geishas-or-just-pretty-men.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2finside-japans-host-clubs-male-geishas-or-just-pretty-men.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2finside-japans-host-clubs-male-geishas-or-just-pretty-men.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2finside-japans-host-clubs-male-geishas-or-just-pretty-men.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-japans-host-clubs-male-geishas-or-just-pretty-men.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-japans-host-clubs-male-geishas-or-just-pretty-men.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sara-paxton-and-zach-cregger.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sara-paxton-and-zach-cregger.html>Sara Paxton and Zach Cregger</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./halle-berry-brown-cargo-pants.html>Halle Berry Pairs Brown Cargo Pants with Heels on Instagram</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./halle-berry-brown-cargo-pants.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
