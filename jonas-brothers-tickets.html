Literally two or three weeks [after Happiness Begins came out] we were with a bunch of our songwriting friends, we went somewhere to record to write and came out with a record pretty much done,” he said at the time. Nick explained at the time that the Jonas Brothers wanted to “wait a second and see what all happens” before they released their sixth album.&nbsp;“Actually, we had the album nearly finished when I last saw you, and right after that we did finish it,” Nick said at the time.“Then, obviously the world changed quite a bit.”</p><p>Kevin told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in 2022 that the Jonas Brothers wrote and recorded most of their sixth album during the current health crisis. “We did record a lot of <a href=# id=auto-tag_music-2 data-tag=music-2>music</a> before and through the pandemic, but then we lived our life for a while,” he said. “We write together, so you’re processing it with your brothers, which is helpful.” Nick added, “It’s some of our favorite stuff we’ve ever done.It’s easy to fall into old creative patterns, but the sound that we’re tapping into is really unique for us.”</p><p>During the interview, the Jonas Brothers also explained how getting married—Kevin is married to Danielle Jonas; Joe is married to Sophie Turner and Nick is married to Priyanka Chopra—and starting their own families affected their relationship and the Jonas Brothers’ music as a whole. “We made an effort today to drive out just us and have breakfast and lunch just to connect,” Joe said of the morning before the Jonas Brothers’ photoshoot for People. “This time in our life and career, we all work quite hard to get that time at home more often, but we also prioritize time with just the three of us because we want to have a strong bond as well.”</p><p>Nick added, “We all have families and live in different places. We’re in a better spot now than we’ve ever been, and it’s a really fun season of discovering what the next chapter is going to look like.” Kevin continued, “Even from afar and through the pandemic, we pretty much always really tried to connect every day. We catch each other up on what’s going on at home and family stuff, but sometimes it’s just to talk about the most random thing.”</p><p>The Jonas Brothers also told People about how the brothers reunited after the “deep rift that caused their breakup in 2013. “Over the years, you start to take advantage of the [sibling] relationship because it’s a safe space,” Joe said. “You feel like you can say anything, and that can be damaging.” Kevin also explained how the six-year break for the Jonas Brothers helped them as musicians. “It allowed us to understand who we were as people,” Kevin said. Nick added, “It made us all better people, I think, finding brilliant partners in life. [They] helped us all to be better versions of ourselves, because I think that’s what they require of us. It’s a beautiful thing to have been able to go on this journey over these last couple of years and mark them with the happiness that we’ve all felt at home. We’re having the time of our lives.”</p><p>Joe also told People about what the Jonas Brothers have learned in their break from each other. “We don’t feel the pressure to go, go, go, constantly like we once did,” he said. He also explained why the group is still making music, more than a decade after they first debuted. “As simple as it may sound, we could have stopped this a long time ago,” he said. “But we decided to keep it going, and that means so much to us in our hearts.”</p><p>Jonas Brothers tickets to their Las Vegas residency are available on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=gmail-s2>StubHub</span></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=gmail-s2>Vivid Seats</span></a>.
