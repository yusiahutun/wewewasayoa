She just finished a screenplay, is an amazing actress, loyal beyond belief, my sandbox partner, kind, generous, glorious and and and and and…”</p><p>A day later, the actress also shared the same picture, captioning it, “Walk through life with women you admire, and they won’t know what hit them. @crystalmreed thank you for your light! Abby x Liz for life!” along with a yellow heart emoji.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Likewise, on December 30, 2019, Sten shared a photo capturing her moments in Rome, Italy, through her Instagram. In response, Reed left a compelling comment that read, “Can’t wait to have my girlfriend back.”</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">comment</a>, garnering over 1000 likes, sparked a flurry of fan reactions. One Instagram user chimed in, saying, “You’re dating Crystal?? Yes, let’s go, gays!” accompanied by a rainbow emoticon.</p><p>The speculation also extended to Twitter, where numerous fans and followers expressed their thoughts. One person joyfully <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a>, “Crystal Reed has a girlfriend, I’m so happy for them,” while another celebrated, “Crystal Reed has girlfriends, 2019 was a win for the gays.”</p><p>Interestingly, some fans adopted a tone of playful jealousy, commenting, “Imagine getting to date Crystal Reed? I had a fat crush on her during my Teen Wolf days. It couldn’t be me.”</p><p>Despite the widespread rumors about a potential relationship between Sten and Reed, neither has confirmed nor denied it. This lack of official confirmation leaves more room for speculation – they could be dating, or perhaps they are simply really good friends.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Maria Sten gay?</h2><p>As of this writing, Sten has not officially come out as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">gay</a> or lesbian, but she has made noteworthy contributions to LGBTQ representation, particularly through her portrayal of the queer character Liz Tremayne in the superhero-horror series Swamp Thing.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>In the series, the actress’ character is portrayed as a local reporter, embodying resilience and a no-nonsense attitude, showcasing her capacity to do more than just hold her own. The depiction includes her engaging in a romantic relationship with Margo.</p><p>Additionally, her role as a close friend to Abby Arcane, played by Crystal Reed, adds depth to her character and aligns with the show’s dedication to diverse representation.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MEA WorldWide (MEAWW)</a>, Sten expressed satisfaction with the storyline in Swamp Thing. She emphasized the importance of discussing and normalizing LGBTQ characters, stating, “I see it to be good and necessary to talk about.”</p><p>Continuing, the actress credited the creators for introducing LGBTQ traits in the show. She stated, “I commend them for that. It’s about time to normalize LGBTQ characters.”</p><p>She also remains optimistic about the significance of such representations in media, underscoring the need to reflect the diversity of the real world.</p><p>Likewise, in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Glitter</a>, Sten shared her thoughts on the changes needed in the Hollywood entertainment industry to foster greater inclusivity. She highlighted the importance of having more people of color (POC) in key positions in the industry, such as showrunners, producers, and writers.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The actress then emphasized that the industry’s transformation must start from the ground up by diversifying roles at the foundational level, including assistants at agencies, production companies, and management firms.</p><p>Sten also highlighted the importance of embracing a diverse perspective that extends beyond people of color, encompassing voices from the LGBTQ+ community, the Asian American experience, the indigenous experience, the Black experience, and various dimensions of the human experience.</p><p>She firmly believes that a comprehensive and diversified perspective is essential for a fuller understanding of the human experience in storytelling.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Maria Sten’s current relationship status</h2><p>Looking at Sten’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> profile, it becomes apparent that she appears to be single, as all of her posts on the platform predominantly revolve around her professional life, with no images suggesting the presence of a boyfriend.</p><p>The actress also deliberately safeguards her personal life, refraining from divulging any details about her dating life in media interviews or public statements.</p><p>When it comes to Sten’s dating history, there have been no publicly known relationships to this date, so there are not many details about her ex-boyfriends. Furthermore, she has also never been married to a husband.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brief on Maria Sten’s career</h2><p>Sten initially showcased her diverse skills by participating in the Miss Supertalent of the World 2011 competition, earning a notable position among the top 7 women out of 50 candidates.</p><p>Transitioning seamlessly into her acting career, she took on the lead role of Jillian Hope Hodgson in the fourth season of the television show Channel Zero: The Dream Door. Building on her success, the actress portrayed Liz Tremayne in the DC Universe television series Swamp Thing.</p><p>Beyond her acting prowess, Sten demonstrated her versatility by venturing into writing, contributing to two episodes of David E. Kelley’s series Big Sky. Impressively, she also took on the roles of writer, director, and producer for the short film Wild Things Run Free.</p><p>Likewise, since 2022, the actress has embraced a transformative role as Frances Neagley in the Amazon Prime Video action crime streaming television series <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/reacher/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Reacher</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/role.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Maria Sten shines as Frances Neagley in ‘Reacher.’ (Source: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Yahoo</a>)</p><p>Her character represents a world unfamiliar to Roscoe (Willa Fitzgerald) and Finlay (Malcolm Goodwin), providing a crucial link for the audience to relate to Reacher and the world he comes from.</p><p>Describing this opportunity as a pivotal moment in her career, Sten shared with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Boston Herald</a>, “When I got the role, that’s when I read all the books that Neagley’s character to get more backstory.”</p><p>As the series progresses into its second season, it promises to reveal the true importance of Neagley to Reacher’s ongoing journey, emphasizing her indispensable role in the unfolding narrative.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK570Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZp6qmaN6pK3HoqOlZZiqwKOtzZ1knKCZobGzsc1o</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ferin-cahill-husband-children.html&text=Do%20Erin%20Cahill%20and%20Her%20Husband%20Paul%20Freeman%20Have%20Children%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ferin-cahill-husband-children.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ferin-cahill-husband-children.html&title=Do%20Erin%20Cahill%20and%20Her%20Husband%20Paul%20Freeman%20Have%20Children%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ferin-cahill-husband-children.html&title=Do%20Erin%20Cahill%20and%20Her%20Husband%20Paul%20Freeman%20Have%20Children%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ferin-cahill-husband-children.html&title=Do%20Erin%20Cahill%20and%20Her%20Husband%20Paul%20Freeman%20Have%20Children%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ferin-cahill-husband-children.html&description=Do%20Erin%20Cahill%20and%20Her%20Husband%20Paul%20Freeman%20Have%20Children%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./new-rochelle-explodes-with-july-4-fireworks.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="New Rochelle Explodes With July 4 Fireworks">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./had-fun-last-night-ex-chief-captain-raped-medic-at-wantagh-fire-house-lawsuit-claims.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Had Fun Last Night': Ex-Chief, Captain Raped Medic At Wantagh Fire House, Lawsuit Claims">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
