Kino and his wife visit the local doctor, who refuses to treat the baby since his parents cannot afford the hospital charges.</p><p class=align-left>Kino goes diving and finds one of the greatest pearls, The Pearl of the <a href=#>World</a>. Knowing he is about to become rich, he starts looking for places to sell it. But, on the other hand, he isn't aware that some of his neighbours are planning to steal it.</p><p class=align-left>Even though the townspeople are plotting against the fisherman, he has big dreams for his family and himself. He dreams of marrying his wife in church, taking his son to school, and buying a rifle. He believes that <a href=#>education</a> is the only way for his son to escape poverty and ignorance.</p><p class=align-left>When the local doctor hears the news about the pearl, he starts treating Coyotito. Unfortunately, even though his mother's remedy heals the baby, the doctor takes advantage of the family's ignorance and takes credit for it. Nevertheless, he still convinces Kino and Juana that the baby is ill and requires more <a href=#>medical attention</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/64913f879e1eec9f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Meet Tyrus children: How many kids does the wrestler have?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Kino agrees to take his son for treatment but promises to pay the charges after selling the pearl. While the doctor visits the baby, he keeps looking for clues on where the pearl is hidden but to no avail. During the same night, a thief breaks into the house, hoping to steal the pearl, to no success.</p><p class=align-left>Shaken by the whole experience, Juana urges Kino to destroy the pearl because she believes it is causing them bad luck. Kino agrees with her and promises to sell the pearl the following morning. Some townspeople try to convince Kino to offer the pearl to the Pope as a gift, but he is determined to sell it.</p><p class=align-left>He takes some of his neighbours with him to search for a buyer. But, unfortunately, all the dealers offer him a thousand pesos even though he believes it is worth at least fifty times more. So finally, dissatisfied with the prices, he opts to go to the capital city to sell the pearl.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1cbc94e96b243c11.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Is ‘Girl in the Closet’ on Lifetime based on a true story?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Again, Juana begs Kino to destroy the pearl, but he refuses, claiming that he won't allow buyers to cheat him. Later that night, Juana takes the pearl and attempts to throw it away back into the ocean. However, Kino catches her before doing that, and she is punished.</p><p class=align-left>Another group of men attacked him, knocking the pearl off his hands. While Juana is watching from a distance, Kino kills one of the men and grabs back his pearl. Although he kills the man in self-defence, he is scared of being charged and thus tells Juana that they must escape.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, their damaged canoe jeopardizes their escape plan while their house is destroyed and set on fire.

Their son was killed by the shots from one of the trackers. Kino takes a rifle from one of the trackers while Juana carries the body of their dead son. They return to La Paz where Kino agrees that the pearl is indeed evil and thus throws it away in the ocean and sighs in relief.</p><h2>The Pearl Setbook notes and themes</h2><p class=align-left>Novels and stories are written to shed light on various important ideas. This is no different for The Pearl Setbook, as it highlights several ideas. The Pearl summary and analysis bring out some of the following key themes:</p><h3>1. Family</h3><p class=align-left>The book's major theme is family and the desire of every man to preserve and sustain it. Everything Kino does is in a bid to preserve his family. For instance, he wants to get the best medicament for his son. Second, after finding the pearl, giving his family a good life is all he can think of. He even kills some of the people who get in his way.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3add52e2b0a30d2e.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>A Silent Song and Other Stories summary notes, themes, and guide</span></p></a><h3>2. Paradox</h3><p class=align-left>When Kino finds the pearl, he believes he will be the wealthiest man in his town. But, on the contrary, it comes with lots of negativity. Instead of <a href=#>bringing good luck</a> and solving all his problems, it causes destruction and creates more trouble.</p><h3>3. Wealth</h3><p class=align-left>The novel brings out the theme of wealth as a bad omen. When Kino doesn't have wealth, he leads a peaceful and happy life with his family. However, immediately after he finds the pearl, hell starts breaking loose. He is nearly killed, forced to leave his home, and eventually, his son dies. However, when he returns the pearl to the ocean, he finds peace again.</p><h3>4. Greed</h3><p class=align-left>Human greed is explicitly seen in several instances throughout the novel. When Kino finds the pearl, he refuses to sell it for a thousand pesos because he believes it is worth at least fifty times more. He is greedy to have more money despite several instances showing that the pearl only causes bad luck. His greed leads to the death of his only son.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9185e601ba914032.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Blood Ties summary, analysis, characters, and ending explained</span></p></a><h3>5. Gender</h3><p class=align-left>The theme of gender in the Mexican coastal region is prevalent in the novel. The entire book has a few women, Juana (Kino's wife) and Apolonia (Juan's wife), while all the other characters are men. While men dominate the novel, the two women are secondary characters with little say.</p><h3>6. Power</h3><p class=align-left>The novel sheds light on the power that comes with <a href=#>having money</a>. When Kino finds the pearl, he knows he will get money, thus becoming more powerful. Also, many people, including the doctor, attempt to steal the pearl because they want a share of the power. He refuses to throw away the pearl because he fears losing power.</p><h3>7. Man and nature</h3><p class=align-left>The Pearl brings out the theme of man and nature, showcasing that man will never win against nature. Immediately Kino finds the pearl; this marks the beginning of his fight with nature. However, he fails to conquer despite his persistence and stubbornness.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0357e2b8d197f181.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 best Aquarius anime characters that you'll love</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The Pearl Setbook perfectly portrays the commonly used phrase; money can't buy you happiness. Despite Kino finding one of the greatest pearls, it brings misery to him and his family. In addition, the novel also brings out several issues, including greed, envy, and family, among others.</p><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke shared an article about<a href=#> An Artist of the Floating World.</a> This is one of the novels that have captured the hearts, minds, and eyes of many readers across the globe.
