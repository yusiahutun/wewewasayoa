Fox had already scored a sizable hit that year with <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>The Detective</strong></a>, a neo-noir mystery based on the bestselling book of the same name by author Roderick Thorp. Rat Pack member <strong>Frank Sinatra </strong>starred as hardened detective Joe Leland, and the film was applauded for its mature depiction of the hazards of procedural work. It wasn't until 1979 that Thorp published the sequel, titled <a href=# rel=nofollow>Nothing Lasts Forever</a>, but Fox owned the rights and Levin knew the story had strong bones. <strong>The potential for an action movie was especially excellent given the plot followed a now-retired Leland fighting a group of terrorists while trapped in a 40-story building</strong>, rather than The Detective's more pensive criminal investigation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/die-hard-film-poster.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Die Hard">Die Hard</a></h5>RActionThriller<p class=display-card-description>A New York City police officer tries to save his estranged wife and several others taken hostage by terrorists during a Christmas party at the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles.</p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>July 20, 1988</span> <strong>Director</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>John McTiernan</a></span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Bruce Willis</a> , Bonnie Bedelia , <a data-id href=#>Reginald VelJohnson</a> , Paul Gleason , William Atherton , Hart Bochner</span> <strong>Runtime</strong> <span>132 minutes</span> <strong>Main Genre</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Action</a></span> <strong>Writers</strong> <span>Roderick Thorp , <a data-id href=#>Jeb Stuart</a> , Steven E. de Souza</span> <strong>Tagline</strong> <span>40 stories of sheer adventure.</span> <strong>Website</strong> <span><a href=#>http://www.foxhome.com/diehardcollection/index_frames.html</a></span> Expand<h2 id=lsquo-die-hard-rsquo-changed-its-source-material-for-the-better>‘Die Hard’ Changed Its Source Material for the Better</h2><p>Initially, Stuart was unsure how to translate the book's dire atmosphere into light popcorn fare (spoiler alert: Forever ends with Leland's daughter, Stephanie, falling to her death from a skyscraper window). Stuart was also overworked and stressed trying to provide for his family with limited pay. The elusive emotional hook clicked in the aftermath of an argument with his wife: as he drove angrily down the interstate, Stuart realized she was right, and an apology was in order. As a writer of thrillers, he knew the key to any work of suspense was investing the audience in the characters. Rather than following an already divorced and bitter Joe Leland with a narrative culminating in tragedy, <strong>Stuart shifted Leland 30 years younger and into a man, renamed John McClane by necessity, who realized he'd done wrong by his wife</strong>. <a href=# rel=nofollow>That slice-of-life spark could plausibly translate into a relatable emotional core</a> and provide the audience with a compelling relationship to care for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Stuart submitted his first draft within weeks. Fox greenlit the project that same weekend with <strong>Joel Silver</strong>, whose success behind other '80s hits like <strong>Commando, Lethal Weapon</strong>, and <strong>Predator</strong>, spoke for itself. Fox wanted the newly christened Die Hard to mimic the same highly violent one-man army style. The movie's elevator pitch morphed into "Rambo in an office building" after the <strong>Sylvester Stallone</strong>-starring <strong>First Blood.</strong></p><h2 id=famous-directors-passed-on-lsquo-die-hard-39>Famous Directors Passed On ‘Die Hard'</h2><span class=txt>Close</span><p>Ironically, therein lay the hiccup: after a decade of profit, Rambo wasn't a style the industry creatives flocked to. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Robocop</strong> director <strong>Paul Verhoeven</strong> turned down an offer</a>, as did Predator's own <strong>John McTiernan</strong> — several times. But Fox executives were insistent, and he agreed on the condition the terrorists become thieves instead, as, from his perspective, <strong>Die Hard needed "some joy" to set it apart from others of its ilk</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Famed directors weren't the only talent to pass. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sinatra, now 70, rejected the script</a>, alongside a veritable roster of revenue-making who's whos: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sylvester Stallone, </a><strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Clint Eastwood, Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, Harrison Ford, Paul Newman, Al Pacino, Richard Gere</strong>, and <strong>Burt Reynolds</strong>. Fox aimed to cast an actor with bankable star power, but with production on a fast track, they turned to the only interested no-name: <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Bruce Willis</strong></a>.</p><h2 id=lsquo-die-hard-rsquo-was-bruce-willis-rsquo-first-leading-role-in-a-movie>‘Die Hard’ Was Bruce Willis’ First Leading Role in a Movie</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/diehard.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time, Bruce Willis was only known for co-starring in the romantic sitcom <strong><a href=#>Moonlighting</a></strong>, and transitioning from the world of television to film was far from an easy leap in the 1980s. (Serving as the singing spokesman for Seagram's Golden Wine Coolers didn't count, more's the pity.) In fact, <strong>Willis’ filming schedule for Moonlighting almost prevented him from accepting his career-making role</strong>. “I think I’d already read the script for Die Hard once,”<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Willis told Entertainment Weekly in 2007</a>, “but had to pass because of [Moonlighting]. As it turns out, a miracle happened —<strong> Cybill Shepherd</strong> got pregnant and they shut down the show for 11 weeks – just the right amount of time for me to run around over at Nakatomi Tower.”</p><p>Fox offered Bruce Willis five million dollars, an unheard-of-sum for anyone who wasn't a long-established legend. Intentionally or not, that sizable paycheck made Die Hard the talk of Tinseltown. All eyes were waiting to scoff at Fox's risk blowing up in their faces as spectacularly as, well, an action movie explosion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After rounding out the supporting cast with fellow unknowns (who the heck was this<strong> </strong><a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Alan Rickman</strong></a> guy anyway?), production occurred inside the Fox Plaza building on the Fox lot. It was important to both McTeirnan and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">director of photography <strong>Jan de Bont</strong></a> to <strong>keep the film grounded in a sense of reality, which meant using locations instead of sets</strong> designed on a studio backlot. The crew was granted full access to several unfinished floors but filmed everything else after business hours, since the Fox lawyers and executives proceeding with their days as normal didn't take too kindly to the frequent and rambunctious commotion.</p><p>Screenwriter<strong> Steven e. de Souza</strong> (<strong>48 Hrs. </strong>and Commando) came aboard to expand the supporting characters so that Willis, still contracted on Moonlighting during the day, could snag some rest after multiple 24-hour days. Working in tandem with Bruce Willis, De Souza also injected the actor's signature smart-ass humor from his Moonlighting tenure. Willis told Entertainment Weekly, “Most of what went into making John McClane from a character standpoint was the South Jersey Bruce Willis — that attitude and disrespect for authority, that gallows sense of humor, the reluctant hero.”<strong> </strong>De Souza also solved the persistent problem of how to get McClane and <a href=# rel=nofollow>Hans Gruber</a>, Alan Rickman's nefarious, suit-elitist villain, face-to-face, after the actor dryly imitated an American accent during a scene break. (Compounding irony upon irony, <a href=#>Rickman almost joined the long list of actors who passed on Die Hard</a>, finding the initial script unimpressive.) De Souza wrote frantically, barely keeping ahead of a ruthless filming schedule.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=improvisation-was-vital-to-lsquo-die-hard-rsquo-s-success>Improvisation Was Vital to ‘Die Hard’s Success</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/collage-maker-12-jan-2023-04-24-pm.jpg><p>John McTiernan and Jan de Bont viewed the action stereotypes of the day as dull and stagnant, so the duo met daily to deliberate over upcoming scenes and improvise what aspects would best make Die Hard stand out as a kinetic, fresh action venture. Such ideas involved maintaining McClane's vulnerability and using handheld cameras to enhance tension (a brand new technique!). The stunt coordinator utilized items already in the building for fight scene props and staged real explosions across the board — so, yes, <strong>they fired actual rocket launchers, blew up a SWAT truck, and shattered every window on one floor simultaneously</strong>. Frustrated neighbors had their sleep interrupted enough that the city permitted only two hours of helicopter use for the crucial "roof explosion" sequence, which happened to be the first scene Bruce Willis shot and a stunt that the crew half-jokingly congratulated him for surviving. De Bont staged twenty-four cameras throughout the city to capture the helicopters swinging past and the effects team contributed miniatures for that particular explosion. Producer Silver couldn't fathom a miniature helicopter as effective. The team was elated to prove him wrong.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Willis and Rickman also chose to perform their students for maximum authenticity. Although Willis had the larger amount, Rickman's involved that famed forty-foot drop onto a blue screen tarp below. The shocked expression on the actor's face was real fear because the crew let him go early, but keeping that face in focus was the tricky part. Given how fast a body falls, a human focus puller simply couldn't manually adjust in real-time, especially on slow-motion analog film, so de Bont asked a small electronics company running tests for the military to adapt one of their automated devices into a camera rig.</p><h2 id=lsquo-die-hard-rsquo-s-influence-changed-the-action-genre>‘Die Hard’s Influence Changed the Action Genre</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/die-hard-john-and-holly-mcclane.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Everyone involved knew from just a rough cut that their efforts paid off into something truly unique. Theater audiences still necessitated a bit of convincing, as they reportedly laughed and booed Willis's appearance in the trailer. Fox cut his face entirely from the posters only to add it back once Die Hard gained traction. Enthusiastic word of mouth brought <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">its worldwide revenue total to $140M</a>, and the industry was shall we say, shook. <strong>The remarkably human character of McClane, equal parts delightful and frustrating, pivoted action heroes away from the uber-masculine stereotype that once dominated American culture</strong>. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">A franchise of five additional films followed suit</a> and the careers of the three leading men changed trajectory at lightning speed: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Willis rose to one of the highest grossing-actors</a> of his day, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Rickman an icon of villainy</a> after his debut film role, and <strong>Reginald VelJohnson</strong> led the popular sitcom <strong>Family Matters</strong> for nine seasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a lovely bit of circular irony, instead of "Rambo in an office building," for decades afterward, action pitches boiled down to "<a href=# rel=nofollow>Die Hard in a location</a>" in hopes of copying the formula for guaranteed success. The star himself agrees: “If I was going to make an action movie today and I hadn’t done Die Hard, I would totally rip it off,” Bruce Willis said. “All the Die Hards will be judged against the first one.”</p><p>Nothing about Die Hard was guaranteed except the tenacity of those creating it behind the scenes. The term "movie magic" may strike as cliché, but even 35 years later, with countless imitators, <a href=# rel=nofollow>few action films remain as tight</a>, electric, and cinematically satisfying — and none spark as many hearty debates about its status as a Christmas movie (it counts as one, thank you).</p><p>Die Hard is available to stream on Prime Video.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer sponsored" class="norewrite noskim">Watch on Prime Video</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51ksaqxjKGYq5xdl7%2B2r8RmrqKknJ7AbsDRrpxmq6Skv7p5xLGnpZmZo7Klew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdie-hard-bruce-willis-true-story-explained.html&text=The%20True%20Story%20Behind%20the%20Making%20of%20%27Die%20Hard%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdie-hard-bruce-willis-true-story-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdie-hard-bruce-willis-true-story-explained.html&title=The%20True%20Story%20Behind%20the%20Making%20of%20%27Die%20Hard%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdie-hard-bruce-willis-true-story-explained.html&title=The%20True%20Story%20Behind%20the%20Making%20of%20%27Die%20Hard%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdie-hard-bruce-willis-true-story-explained.html&title=The%20True%20Story%20Behind%20the%20Making%20of%20%27Die%20Hard%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdie-hard-bruce-willis-true-story-explained.html&description=The%20True%20Story%20Behind%20the%20Making%20of%20%27Die%20Hard%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./treasure-lake-property-owners-association-comments-on-ski-lodge-closure.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Treasure Lake Property Owner's Association comments on Ski Lodge closure">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./randy-travis-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Randy Travis Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
