An adolescent with strong self-worth and self-esteem grows into a self-assured adult ready to follow their ambitions. Early encouragement of teen self-confidence is crucial for your child’s future.

Motivating oneself is the aim.</li><li><strong>Break down large objectives into smaller assignments:</strong> One smart way to promote positive behaviour is to break down big goals into smaller tasks and give rewards for completing smaller ones. For instance, some young children may find learning how to dress themselves intimidating. Let them practice putting on underwear first so they can become proficient at this new ability.
