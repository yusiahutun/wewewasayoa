While she is well known as the daughter of American pastor and writer Charles Stanley, many things about her are unknown. Here are some of them:</p><h3>1. Her mother filed for divorce twice</h3><p class=align-left>Becky Stanley's family are Christians. Her father founded the In Touch Ministries, and her mother was a Bible teacher and musician. Despite their Christian teaching about family, Anna Stanley found it challenging to continue her marriage. Thus, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">filed for divorce twice</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Anna Stanley tied the knot with Charles Stanley in 1955. Charles was still a student when the two married. However, he worked hard and became a pastor in 1971.</p><p class=align-left>In the early 1990s, the couple experienced challenges in their marriage. They had been married for almost four decades and had welcomed two children. Finally, Anna filed for divorce in 1993 without citing the reason for <a href=#>dissolving her marriage.</a></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/baa3d71d5dafb26e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Deborah Meaden's net worth now: Is she the richest Dragon?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The news reached the church, and it was bad news for Charles. That is because church leaders at that time were not allowed to serve the congregation, and the option was to resign. But Charles and Anna reconciled, and the divorce was never formalised. In 1996, Anna withdrew her divorce plea.</p><p class=align-left>The divorce withdrawal was short-lived. Becky’s mother filed for a second divorce in 2000. In her second divorce application, Anna noted that her marriage was irretrievably broken despite being married to Charles for 44 years. With no sight of reconciliation and turning back, the divorce was finalised the same year.</p><h3>2. Her mother and father died</h3><p class=align-left>Anna Johnson Stanley <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">died on 10 November 2014</a>, aged 83. However, the cause of her death was not revealed to the public, with the <a href=#>family</a> claiming she died peacefully in sleep.</p><p class=align-left>Becky Stanley’s father, Charles Stanley, <a id=https://www.vizaca.com/anna-stanley-obituary/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">died on 18 April 2023</a>.
