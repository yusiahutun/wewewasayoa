<time>25 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Given the service's two billion active users, it's perhaps no surprise that WhatsApp spam is a common issue. Whether it's a scam, a phishing attempt, or just plain old marketing drivel from companies, you need to know how to spot WhatsApp dangers, so you can block the sender; and make sure you're not putting your security at risk.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So what does WhatsApp spam look like? What can you do about it? And how do you block a contact on WhatsApp?</p><h2 id=how-to-recognize-whatsapp-spam>How to Recognize WhatsApp Spam</h2><p>Here are our top ways to spot WhatsApp spam, along with some advice on what steps you should take if you receive such a message.</p><h3 id=frequently-forwarded-messages>1. Frequently-Forwarded Messages</h3><p>Most WhatsApp users will be aware that the app lets you forward messages received from one person directly to another recipient (for those who didn't know, long-press a message and tap the forward option on the pop-up menu that appears).</p><p>However, users might be less aware that WhatsApp has a separate indicator for frequently-forwarded messages. When a message has been forwarded five times, you'll see a double arrow icon rather than the single arrow that denotes a typical forwarded message.</p><p>You'll also see a small warning on the message box itself, letting you know that the message has been "forwarded many times."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The distinction is important: if a message has been forwarded more than five times, it's almost always going to be a form of spam—whether that's yet another boring meme that's doing the rounds, fake news, or something more sinister.</p><h3 id=unrecognized-numbers>2. Unrecognized Numbers</h3><p>WhatsApp lets you send a message to anyone whose phone number you have. That means that the senders of spam can scrape the web for contact details, buy lists of active numbers from the dark web, and even hack other services that have your phone number on file, then send you an unsolicited message.</p><p>It's highly unlikely you'll ever have such a sender in your address book, which means that when it lands in your WhatsApp inbox, it will always show as an unrecognized number.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sure, you'll occasionally get a random WhatsApp message from an unrecognized number that turns out to be a buddy who's changed numbers, but most of the time, they will be spam.</p><p>Although it is not a foolproof approach, one way to discourage some people from sending you unsolicited messages is to <a href=#>hide your WhatsApp status</a>. The sender will not be able to determine whether your account is even active.</p><h3 id=scams-and-suspicious-links>3. Scams and Suspicious Links</h3><p>A huge part of WhatsApp spam has a single purpose—to try and make you open a link in the message. Click on the link at your peril; it's going to try and illicit your personal details, banking details, login credentials, or any other form of data that has value on the dark web.</p><p>Many famous WhatsApp scams of the last few years have used this form of spam...</p><ul><li><strong>WhatsApp Gold:</strong> A supposedly premium version of WhatsApp was spammed to millions of users throughout 2016. Clicking on the link and sending a payment would apparently get you access to a fancier version of WhatsApp that celebrities were using. Countless people fell for it.</li><li><strong>WhatsApp expiration:</strong> Another classic WhatsApp scam. You'll see a message claiming that your WhatsApp account has expired and you need to pay to reactivate it. Remember, WhatsApp never charges to download the app and will not levy any new charges on your account once you're up and running.</li><li><strong>Shopping vouchers:</strong> One of the most common WhatsApp scams, you'll get a message offering $250 of high street shopping vouchers if you complete a survey. In practice, the only thing you'll receive in exchange for your efforts is a stolen identity.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you receive a WhatsApp message from an unknown international number, take a look at the number’s first digits. Each phone number starts with the country code. If the code doesn’t match their supposed location, the chances are they are trying to scam you.</p><p>Most WhatsApp scammers use a fake location to hide their identity or add credibility to their stories. If you want to find more information, you can <a href=#>use a free reverse phone number lookup tool</a>.</p><h3 id=login-verification-requests>4. Login/Verification Requests</h3><p>You cannot use WhatsApp for two-factor authentication (2FA) on any app or service that we're aware of. Of course, <a href=#>you absolutely should set up 2FA</a> on all your accounts; it's one of the best ways to make sure they're secure even if someone has managed to get hold of your login credentials—but those 2FA messages will never arrive on WhatsApp.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ideally, you should <a href=#>use dedicated 2FA apps</a> and hardware like Google Authenticator or YubiKey, but at the very least they'll arrive via a direct SMS. If you receive such a message on WhatsApp, and you've not tried to log in anywhere recently, don't worry. It doesn't mean someone is trying to hack your account. The message is spam, and you can safely ignore and block it.</p><h3 id=specific-wording>5. Specific Wording</h3><p>Spam often uses the same generic tactics to try and dupe you. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WhatsApp itself</a>, there are five common types of wording in messages that you need to be aware of:</p><ul><li>Misspellings or grammatical mistakes.</li><li>Asking you to tap on a link or activate new features through a link.</li><li>Asking you to share your personal information, such as credit card or bank account numbers, birthdate, and passwords.</li><li>Asking you to forward a message.</li><li>Claiming that you have to pay to use WhatsApp.</li></ul><p>If you receive a message that matches one of the criteria, you should delete it immediately.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-to-manage-and-reduce-whatsapp-spam>How to Manage and Reduce WhatsApp Spam</h2><p>Once you've identified a WhatsApp message as spam, what are the next steps you need to follow?</p><h3 id=how-to-report-a-number-on-whatsapp>1. How to Report a Number on WhatsApp</h3><p>WhatsApp Business lets companies interact with their customers through the WhatsApp interface. It is a violation of WhatsApp's terms to use the WhatsApp Business tool for bulk messaging and unsolicited contact.</p><p>Since the start of 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WhatsApp</a> has appeared to take transgressions of the rule very seriously:</p><p>Our products are not intended for bulk or automated messaging, both of which have always been a violation of our Terms of Service. Beginning on December 7, 2019, WhatsApp will take legal action against those we determine are engaged in or assisting others in abuse that violates our Terms of Service, such as automated or bulk messaging [...] even if that determination is based on information solely available to us off our platform.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you receive an unsolicited message from a business account, you should file a WhatsApp report immediately. You report a spam number by opening the chat, going to the business' profile, and scrolling down to tap <strong>Report Business</strong>. Finally, tap <strong>Report</strong> on the pop-up window.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/screenshot-of-business-page-info-on-whatsapp-mobile.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/report-window-on-whatsapp-mobile.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/business-report-sent-notification-on-whatsapp-mobile.jpg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>But what happens when you report someone or a business on WhatsApp? Unfortunately, we don't really know. Encryption means WhatsApp cannot see the contents of the message, but they will be able to see a log of your interactions and other associated data.</p><p>WhatsApp only says it will "launch an investigation." If the sender is found to be in breach of the Terms of Service, their account could be suspended or banned.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Remember, blocking numbers is just one way you can <a href=#>make your WhatsApp account more secure</a>.</p><h3 id=how-to-block-someone-on-whatsapp>2. How to Block Someone on WhatsApp</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/block-prompt-on-whatapp-mobile.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/chat-showing-contact-blocked-on-whatsapp-mobile.jpg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>One of the old adages of creating an enjoyable Twitter experience is blocking early and often. The same philosophy applies to WhatsApp spam messages. Don't sit there getting frustrated as an endless stream of cat facts lands in your inbox; just block the account at the first sign of trouble.</p><p>You can block WhatsApp accounts by going to the contact's profile, scrolling down, and tapping<strong> Block [name]</strong>. Finally, tap <strong>Block</strong> on the pop-up window. That's it. The blocked contact will no longer be able to contact you on WhatsApp.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=exit-suspicious-group-chats>3. Exit Suspicious Group Chats</h3><p>Spammers are trying to contact as many people as possible, so you might become a member of multiple suspicious group chats. If you’ve been added to a group and the conversation is filled with scam signs such as links, frequently-forwarded messages, or “amazing business opportunities”, it’s better to leave it. To do so, tap the <strong>three-dot </strong>icon from the top-right corner and select <strong>More > Exit group</strong>.</p><h3 id=restrict-who-can-add-you-to-groups>4.
