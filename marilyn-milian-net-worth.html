Marilyn Milian is most famous for being the presiding judge on the television series The People's Court. Milian took over this role in 2001, bringing a fresh and dynamic approach to the series.</p><p>Prior to her television career, Milian had a notable legal career. After earning her law degree from Georgetown University Law Center, she spent several years as an assistant state attorney for the Dade County State Attorney's Office. In 1999, she was appointed to the Miami Circuit Court by Governor <a href=# title="Jeb Bush Net Worth">Jeb Bush</a>, where she served in the Criminal Division.</p><p>Milian's tenure on "The People's Court" has been marked by her sharp legal mind, quick wit, and compassionate approach to justice. Her ability to explain complex legal concepts in a relatable manner has endeared her to a broad audience, making her a respected figure in the realm of legal-themed television.</p><h2 id=early-life-early-career><strong>Early Life and Early Career</strong></h2><p>She was born on May 1, 1961 in Manhattan, NY the daughter of Cuban immigrants. She earned an undergraduate degree in psychology from the University of Miami, where she graduated summa cum laude with a 4.0 GPA. She then earned a J.D. cum laude from Georgetown University Law Center. While studying at Georgetown, she and her fellow law students used to watch The People's Court every day in between classes. Decades before becoming a TV star, Marilyn served as an assistant state attorney in Dade County, Florida. In 1999, Florida Governor Jeb Bush appointed her to the Miami Circuit Court. She also spent five years as a judge in Florida Domestic Violence courts.</p><h2 id=people8217s-court><strong>The People's Court</strong></h2><p>Ratings for the show tanked under Jerry Sheindlin, <a href=#>Judge Judy's</a> husband, who headed the show from 1999 to 2001. Jerry took over from former NYC mayor Ed Koch who took over from original host <a href=# title="Joseph Wapner Net Worth">Joseph Wapner</a> who served from 1981 â€“ 1993. Looking at the falling ratings, producers decided they needed someone young, Hispanic and preferably female to appeal to their growing Latina audience. They looked far and wide for the right person. Marilyn was referred by a male neighbor who auditioned but had been rejected. The producers had to call her 16 times before she finally picked up to hear their proposal.</p><p>Marilyn Milian was the first Latina judge to preside over a televised court program. Soon after taking over the role, ratings increased a whopping 75%. After the 2012-2013 season she officially became the longest-running host of The People's Court. She is noted for interacting with the audience much more than her predecessors. She frequently quotes her grandmother when addressing the litigants, often in Spanish.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-280910 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/mm.jpg alt="Judge Marilyn Milian" width=602 height=564 sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-280910 class=wp-caption-text>GETTY</p><h2 id=marilyn-milian-husband><strong>Marilyn Milian Husband</strong></h2><p>Milian's husband John Schlesinger is also a lawyer and judge. He actually serves in Marilyn's former district, the 11th Circuit for Miami-Dade County. Their primary residence is a home in Coral Gables. They also keep an apartment in New York City where the show tapes twice per month. They have three children. Because he is still a judge, John is required to report periodic financial disclosures. From his 2009 disclosure we learned that the couple at the time was worth at least $7 million, not including a $3 million house and $200,000 worth of sports cars. After adjusting for inflation, the couple was worth at least $12 million in 2009. He has not released a financial disclosure since 2009.</p><h2 id=marilyn-milian-salary><strong>Marilyn Milian Salary</strong></h2><p>In her first year as host of The People's Court, Marilyn earned just $500 thousand per year. That was soon raised to $1 million. After the first four years wrapped and she had proven a huge success, the salary was increased to $5 million. In 2018 that salary was bumped to $8 million per year. She travels to the New York area twice a month to tape. They tape 10 episodes in a day over three days then she travels back to Miami. Between 2001 and 2013 the show taped in New York City. It has taped in Stamford, Connecticut since then.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97y5qusp2iqHyurdGio7KmXaK2rbXAp2SnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmarilyn-milian-net-worth.html&text=Marilyn%20Milian%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmarilyn-milian-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmarilyn-milian-net-worth.html&title=Marilyn%20Milian%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmarilyn-milian-net-worth.html&title=Marilyn%20Milian%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmarilyn-milian-net-worth.html&title=Marilyn%20Milian%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmarilyn-milian-net-worth.html&description=Marilyn%20Milian%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./rumer-willis-embraces-mama-curves-stunning-new-bikini-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rumer Willis embraces her 'mama curves' in stunning new bikini photos">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./richest-celebrities.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Joey Diaz Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
