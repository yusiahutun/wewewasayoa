Both face life imprisonment.<br>&nbsp;<br>State prosecutor Chantal Moulin-Bernard said Sabatier, a removals man, and his partner had four other children from previous relationships. Marina came in for especially cruel treatment because she had mild Down’s syndrome, and was often underfed.<br>&nbsp;<br>‘They beat Marina in an especially brutal manner, mainly because she was greedy and always asking for food,’ said Mrs Moulin-Bernard.<br>&nbsp;<br>‘The child was locked in a cellar one night, and was found inanimate in the morning. The body was initially hidden in a deep freeze at another site, before being put in a trunk which was filled with cement.’</p><p>It was found in store room of the company where Sabatier worked in Le Mans, north-west France.</p><p>When Marina’s half-brothers and sisters asked where she was they were told ‘she’s on holiday at the seaside,’ said Mrs Moulin-Bernard.<br></p><p>In a case which has shocked France, teachers said they had alerted social services to bruises found all over Marina’s body at two primary schools she attended, but investigations were scrapped.</p><p>‘We did what we could but to no effect,’ said Jean-Luc Dubois, the headmaster of Coulans-sur-Gee primary school who voiced concerns about Marina in April.</p><p>‘We were particularly worried because Marina was the subject of a report from a neighbouring village.’<br></p><p>Marina was a notoriously thin pupil, and would regularly try and steal food from the plates of other children, said Mr Dubois.</p><p>The Prefect of the Sarthe department has now ordered an investigation, with social workers putting the tragedy down to the family frequently changing address.</p><p>Over the past five years they had moved no less than five times, so making it hard for anybody to keep up with what they were doing.</p><p>The couple, who have four other children from previous partners, simply blamed the bruises on a fall.</p><p>It is the second time this year that French social services have missed a serious case of child abuse.</p><p>Earlier this year, a seven-year-old boy was released from a house in the southern town of Millau where he had been locked up in secret since he was born.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2Bc32Sam9uZ4CWv6a606xknKSRnrqmsIydmK6fmKmys3nKopunmaClsqV5wqGYq5%2BVmXquwdGdnKtmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fparents-claimed-daughter-kidnapped-charged-murder-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fparents-claimed-daughter-kidnapped-charged-murder-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fparents-claimed-daughter-kidnapped-charged-murder-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fparents-claimed-daughter-kidnapped-charged-murder-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fparents-claimed-daughter-kidnapped-charged-murder-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fparents-claimed-daughter-kidnapped-charged-murder-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./best-running-books-read-while-bored-lockdown-scott.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./best-running-books-read-while-bored-lockdown-scott.html>The best running books to read while bored in lockdown, from Scott Jureks story to finding the Ke</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./perm-hair-volume-trend.html>Is the perm the biggest most surprising hair trend for 2020?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./perm-hair-volume-trend.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
