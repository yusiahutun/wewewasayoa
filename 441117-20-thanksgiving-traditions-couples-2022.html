This holiday is to celebrate the year that has been and to show grace and gratitude for what life has offered. With the digitization of things, Thanksgiving is gradually becoming universal despite not being an official national holiday in most countries. Families have thanksgiving traditions. There are also thanksgiving traditions for couples.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cc06f47e6f3834bb.jpg><p class=align-left>To celebrate thanksgiving day with your loved one is a blessing. Many people travel across different regions to be with those they love during this period. Couples who stay together enjoy Thanksgiving as a holiday because it brings families together and marks the beginning of the festive season for most. There are plenty of thanksgiving couple ideas you can try this year.</p><h2>Thanksgiving traditions for couples</h2><p class=align-left>More than any other holiday, Thanksgiving is associated with substantial <a href=#>family</a> get-togethers. However, if you don't have the luxury of celebrating with them, you can still enjoy it with your significant other. Here is a list of the top 20 thanksgiving traditions for couples to try out in 2022.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c4138ac72bc8cef3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Happy marriage quotes: 100+ sweet wishes, messages, SMS for a new couple</span></p></a><h3>1. Go shopping together</h3><p class=align-left>Some people believe that going shopping can put your mind at ease. Thanksgiving is all about being grateful for life and being at ease and at peace, so why not go shopping? Take a trip to the mall and have you and your partner shop for all you need.</p><p class=align-left>Pick your favourite red dress or the mauve suit you have admired the whole year. Treat yourself and buy all the nice things that money can buy.</p><h3>2. Take a walk</h3><p class=align-left>Taking a walk is therapeutic. Take a stroll in the <a href=#>neighbourhood</a> with your significant other, talking and just sharing ideas. You can also walk to a nearby park or forest to bond with nature.</p><p class=align-left>Walking is a good exercise and kills the monotony of spending the day sited in the house. This activity is also refreshing. Nothing beats a good slow walk with your lover. This is one of the most incredible thanksgiving ideas for couples.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1c8fb59f0e2d6606.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ best graduation captions to share on your Instagram</span></p></a><h3>3. Visit the less fortunate</h3><p class=align-left>You sure are grateful for your life and all the good things happening to you, but what about those that are not so lucky? Thanksgiving is about showing gratitude and having a good time. Be a blessing to someone.</p><p class=align-left>You can visit the homeless with your boyfriend or girlfriend. Prepare them a nice home-cooked meal, and you will see how their faces will brighten. Carry clothes that are unused in your house. Go to your local children's home and give them treats they rarely have.</p><h3>4. Go for a drive</h3><p class=align-left>Not sure of romantic thanksgiving ideas? Think of a quiet road that has scenic views and take a drive along that road; a drive on that road. Avoid highways because of how crazy some motorists can be.</p><p class=align-left>Instead, drive away from the noise in the city and take country roads. You will be surprised just how satisfying driving with your partner can be. Listen to music or podcasts on the way and carry snacks that you can share when you take mini breaks while on the road.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f56e557b8154b05e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best Islamic birthday wishes for your loved ones</span></p></a><h3>5. Prepare meals</h3><p class=align-left>Cooking together is one of the best ways of bonding. It is such a nice feature when you and your partner enjoy cooking or spending time in the kitchen. Cooking does not have to be boring. Explore new recipes and try out dishes that you see on cooking shows.</p><p class=align-left>The internet has plenty of material when it comes to food recipes. You will have a good time trying and perhaps even failing the recipes you try. The whole activity does not have to be serious like a chef Ramsay-like cooking contest; you need to have a good time trying out the recipes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c4138ac72bc8cef3.jpg><h3>6. Keep a gratitude jar</h3><p class=align-left>It does not matter how often you have told your partner that you are grateful; a gratitude jar will make things even more pleasant. Look for an empty glass jar and write all the nice things you can think of.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f3f8cb4899b28702.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 funniest happy birthday memes</span></p></a><p class=align-left>What are you grateful for in life? Are you thankful that your wife or husband chose to share life with you? Write all the good things and read them out loud later.</p><h3>7. Steal away for a moment</h3><p class=align-left>This may not be comfortable, but you can try it anyway. Thanksgiving means that family will probably be around. Your house may be full as you host your aunties, in-laws, cousins, and other relatives.</p><p class=align-left>While everyone is busy catching up, cooking or watching, steal away a minute and have a moment with your lover. You could cuddle up or engage in any intimate activity that you can think of. Just ensure that you do not leave the door ajar with the many guests in the house.</p><h3>8. Watch a romantic movie</h3><p class=align-left>Romance is a beautiful thing, and that is one of the primary reasons you are with your significant other. You can never miss a good romance <a href=# title>movie</a> to watch. Look for classics, check out new movies and binge-watch with your lover. You can also look for adult content if you are up to it. Watching a movie together is one of the cutest things a couple can do during Thanksgiving.</p><h3>9. Foot rubs</h3><p class=align-left>Foot Rubs are heavenly. Who does not like foot rubs? Everyone wants to have their feet massaged. An unexplained feeling of satisfaction comes with getting your feet rubbed. The sensation is even better when the rubbing of feet is done by a person you are madly in love with.</p><p class=align-left>So why not give your partner some nice foot rubs and have them do the same for you? It is a fantastic way of spending time together during the holidays.</p><h3>10. Lounge together</h3><p class=align-left>You can be a couch potato with your partner, and there is nothing wrong with that. Thanksgiving has everyone up and running as they do shopping, meet friends and family and engage in holiday activities. However, not all thanksgivings need to have you up and running; you can decide to chill at home with your lover and lounge together.</p><p class=align-left>Sit on the couch wrapped in a warm blanket as you cuddle or chat. You can also lounge while doing different things like browsing the internet or watching preferred movies or documentaries.</p><h3>11. Write down wishes</h3><p class=align-left>Having a wishlist motivates you to work hard for something and makes your partner know what you are craving. Write down your wishes for the products or services you wish would happen for you. Then, you can read them aloud, tour your spouse and have them do the same. You never know; the universe way grants you your wish sooner just by saying it aloud.</p><h3>12. Try something you have never tried before</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1c8fb59f0e2d6606.jpg><p class=align-left>It is thanksgiving, and everyone is happy; try out something new as a couple. Always wanted to go bungee jumping? Is skiing something that you have been considering? Do you wish to get matching tattoos? Have you ever wanted to get stupid drunk while in the house? This is the time to try all the sweet or even crazy things you wish to do with your lover.</p><h3>13. Link up with family members online</h3><p class=align-left>Technology is a blessing to many. With a communication device and good <a href=# title>internet</a>, you can virtually meet your loved one who is across the globe. Take this time to make video calls with loved ones you have not seen for months or even years.</p><p class=align-left>Call different family members and do the same with your spouse’s family. Make memories with your loved ones despite the distance.</p><h3>14. Set up a minibar</h3><p class=align-left>It's the holidays; what to do on Thanksgiving without family? Make that bloody Mary the best way you know and enjoy your drink. Have you ever wanted to try different cocktails all at once? This is your time to shine.</p><p class=align-left>Get everything you need and have your partner help you with many cocktails and all the drinks you think of. You can then enjoy your drinks or even share them with your neighbours. Nothing tats as good as a homemade Bloody Mary on a Thanksgiving night.</p><h3>15. Acts of service for others</h3><p class=align-left>Make someone smile on Thanksgiving by performing acts of service to them. Thanksgiving and generally holidays will have you. Pay for someone's meal at the café, buy them coffee or their favourite beverages.</p><p class=align-left>Another great service would be to help clean your community. You can also visit your elderly neighbour and help them with house chores. Another selfless act would be to participate in a charity event. There are usually many of those during the holiday season.</p><h3>16. Play a game</h3><p class=align-left>One way to cheer yourself up is by playing games. There are plenty of games to play. Game of charades can be entertaining even without a crowd. Play games like Chess or Checkers.</p><p class=align-left>Other board games that you can play with your girlfriend or boyfriend include The Castle of Burgundy, Splendor, Fog of Love, Ticket to Ride, and 7 Wonders duel. Video games could also be an option if both of you enjoy that.</p><h3>17. Reserve a table for dinner outside</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f56e557b8154b05e.jpg><p class=align-left>Yes, everyone wants that well-prepared home turkey for Thanksgiving and no, it does not always have to be that! Go out and try something else this Thanksgiving. You can reserve a table of two at that restaurant you have always wished to go to.</p><p class=align-left>Worked up on thanksgiving gift ideas for boyfriend or girlfriend? Have earlier meals at home but reserve dinner for outside the house. You will be surprised just how many people take pleasure in restaurant meals during Thanksgiving.</p><h3>18. Hot tubbing</h3><p class=align-left>Hot tubbing with your partner is both sexy and intimate. Try hot-tubbing this <a href=#>Thanksgiving</a> and see just how much your spouse enjoys it. Apart from bonding with your sugar pie on a deeper level, hot tubbing is also healthy for you.</p><p class=align-left>The heat in the tub broadens blood vessels, sending nutrient-rich blood throughout your body. The hot water also loosens tight muscles.</p><h3>19. Go for a professional photoshoot</h3><p class=align-left>Almost everyone has a smartphone, and you have dozens of pictures together with your spouse. You take pictures while going to the mall for shopping, while on dates while visiting friends and many other times.</p><p class=align-left>Do you know what's better than that? Having professional photographers take high-quality pictures for you. There are many freelance photographers with affordable rates online.</p><p class=align-left>Check their Instagram or websites to know the kind of photos they take. Going for photoshoots together should be a regular thing for couples that like taking photos.</p><h3>20. Break the wishbone</h3><p class=align-left>When breaking a fishbone, the holder of the longer portion automatically gets to make a wish first. This is often entertaining as everyone wants to be left with the longer portion when breaking wishbones. Why not try this with your husband or wife after having that hearty meal at home? Then, break the fishbone and crack funny jokes as you do other activities.</p><p class=align-left>Thanksgiving means good vibes and making memories with friends, family and your significant other. Make a list of the things you want to try every Thanksgiving and get to do them. Make Thanksgiving traditions for couples a thing that you observe in your home. Do not let the holiday pass without trying something you have always wanted to try; if you are happy and grateful for life, do not let this holiday go to waste.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> shared an article on the 20 most <a href=#>unique hobbies</a> that you can do at home in 2021.
