Based on the children's book of the same name by <strong>Emma Yarlett</strong>, the movie follows Orion, a boy with an active imagination who faces his many fears on an unforgettable journey through the night with his new friend, the Dark.</p><p>Orion has plenty of the signatures that make it clear this is definitely a movie written by Charlie Kaufman, except this time, it's the kiddos who get to be instilled with existential angst. While <strong>it's clear that some of Kaufman's original ideas received lots of changes during shooting</strong>, watering many elements down to disappointingly traditional children's film fare, this is still a terrific movie about facing one's fears and living life to the fullest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h5 class=display-card-title>Orion and the Dark</h5>TV-Y7AnimationAdventureComedy<p class=display-card-description></p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>February 2, 2024</span> <strong>Director</strong> <span>Sean Charmatz</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Jacob Tremblay</a> , <a data-id href=#>Paul Walter Hauser</a> , Werner Herzog</span> <strong>Runtime</strong> <span>93 minutes</span><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on Netflix</a></span></p><h2 id=39-confessions-of-a-dangerous-mind-39-2002><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' (2002)</span></h2><h3 id=directed-by-george-clooney>Directed by George Clooney</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/george-clooney_sam-rockwell_confessions-of-a-dangerous-mind.jpg><p><strong>George Clooney</strong>'s surprisingly good directing debut, the aptly titled <a href=#><strong>Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</strong></a>, is about real-life figure <strong>Chuck Barris</strong> – TV producer by day, CIA assassin by night. From this premise alone, one might imagine how much fun a writer like Kaufman can have with the inherently zany material; and yet, this is the artist's most "traditional" script, with pretty much none of his typical surrealistic and bizarre tendencies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike most of the screenwriter's work, which tends to offer much thought-provoking material to sink one's teeth into, <strong>Confessions of a Dangerous Mind settles for being mostly just fun and entertaining, which works great</strong>. Although it's wonkily paced and has a rather unsatisfying ending, the film is nevertheless a very pleasant watch, arguably one of <a href=#>the most underrated thriller movies of recent years</a>.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on Fubo</a></span></p><h2 id=39-i-39-m-thinking-of-ending-things-39-2020><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' (2020)</span></h2><h3 id=directed-by-charlie-kaufman>Directed by Charlie Kaufman</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Im-Thinking-Of-Ending-Things-Jessie-Buckley-Jesse-Plemons.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"What's it about?" is perhaps the most useless question to ask about a Charlie Kaufman piece. His films are self-referential beyond measure, and even that is just the tip of the iceberg. This is especially true of the Netflix original <strong><a href=#>I'm Thinking of Ending Things</a></strong>, based on <strong>Iain Reid</strong>'s novel of the same name, about a young woman having second thoughts about her relationship when she joins her boyfriend on a road trip to meet his parents.</p><p>The film, with amazing performances by <strong>Jesse Plemons</strong>, <strong>Jessie Buckley</strong>, <strong>Toni Collette</strong>, and <strong>David Thewlis</strong>, might be <strong>Kaufman's most bizarre and atmospheric</strong>. The eerie tone is enthralling and the narrative is a real edge-of-your-seat mind-bending thriller, even if its weirdness sometimes feels gratuitous and self-indulgent. It's only Kaufman's third (and so far latest) directing effort, though, so there's certainly lots of room for him to grow.</p><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="I'm Thinking of Ending Things">I'm Thinking of Ending Things</a></h5>R Where to Watch<p class=availability>*Availability in US</p><ul class=tab-container id=tab-container-139186><li id=tab-stream-139186 class=selected>stream</li><li id=tab-rent-139186>rent</li><li id=tab-buy-139186>buy</li></ul><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored" title="Stream on Netflix"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/netflix_logo-2.jpg></a><p class=not-available>Not available</p><p class=not-available>Not available</p><p class=display-card-description></p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>September 4, 2020</span> <strong>Director</strong> <span>Charlie Kaufman</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Jesse Plemons</a> , <a data-id href=#>Jessie Buckley</a> , <a data-id href=#>Toni Collette</a></span> <strong>Runtime</strong> <span>134 minutes</span> <strong>Main Genre</strong> <span>Drama</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=39-anomalisa-39-2015><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>'Anomalisa' (2015)</span></h2><h3 id=directed-by-charlie-kaufman-and-duke-johnson>Directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Michael-and-Lisa-from-Anomalisa.jpg><p>Audiences looking for <a href=#>mind-bending existentialist masterpieces</a> that will make them reevaluate their lives really ought to look into the second film directed by Kaufman (in collaboration with <strong>Duke Johnson</strong>), his venture into the medium of stop-motion animation: <strong><a href=#>Anomalisa</a></strong>. It's the tale of an aging man voiced by <strong>David Thewlis</strong> who's incapable of forming healthy connections, and how a lively woman voiced by <strong>Jennifer Jason Leigh</strong> arrives to shake up his existence.

Being John Malkovich is a surrealist magnum opus about an unsuccessful puppeteer (<strong>John Cusack</strong>) who one day at work finds a portal into the head of actor <strong>John Malkovich</strong> and decides to exploit it as a business opportunity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many superlatives can be used when describing this film. One of the most intelligent films ever, one of the funniest films ever, and perhaps the single most creative film ever. In summary: <strong>Far and away the best movie Kaufman has written</strong>. The way it explores themes like self-actualization and existential dread is masterful, and the story never ceases to be incredibly entertaining and darkly humorous. For those looking to see what the hype about Charlie Kaufman is all about, his best movie is definitely a good place to start.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Rent on Amazon</a></span></p><p><span class=next-single>KEEP READING:<a href=#>The Best Screenplays of All Time, Ranked</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51ksKmt0aWgnmWblsKnucCnZKanpp6ytHnRmqWknZRk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcharlie-kaufman-movies-ranked.html&text=All%209%20Movies%20Written%20by%20Charlie%20Kaufman%2c%20Ranked&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcharlie-kaufman-movies-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcharlie-kaufman-movies-ranked.html&title=All%209%20Movies%20Written%20by%20Charlie%20Kaufman%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcharlie-kaufman-movies-ranked.html&title=All%209%20Movies%20Written%20by%20Charlie%20Kaufman%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcharlie-kaufman-movies-ranked.html&title=All%209%20Movies%20Written%20by%20Charlie%20Kaufman%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcharlie-kaufman-movies-ranked.html&description=All%209%20Movies%20Written%20by%20Charlie%20Kaufman%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./easy-method-to-land-trick-points-with-a-dirt-bike-in-fortnite-chapter-4-season-1.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Easy Method to Land Trick Points with a Dirt Bike in Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 1">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-was-emily-gerding-go-fund-me-for-minnesota-car-crash-victims-family-raises-over-150-k.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who was Emily Gerding?
