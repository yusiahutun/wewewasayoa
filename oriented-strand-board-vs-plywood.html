To my eye, however, it made the room look and feel like a workshop. But not everyone would agree!</p><p>“It really depends on the specifics of your project and what matters most to you,” says interior designer Elizabeth Vergara when asked if OSB looks good in a home setting. “I mainly work with luxury apartments and residential homes. Most of my clients are open to splurging on premium quality items to achieve a luxury aesthetic.”</p><p>OSB wall paneling, in other words, does not equal luxury. On that score, I couldn’t agree more. The real value of OSB is in its structural integrity. Building codes, the Engineered Wood Association, architects and most builders rate plywood and OBS sheathing as equal in strength and durability. There’s no doubt that plywood, with its smooth face, looks better than OSB. Looks aren’t everything, though.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=about-the-expert></span>About the Expert<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><strong>Elizabeth Vergara</strong> has been helping homeowners design and renovate their upscale homes for over 13 years.

It’s available in 4-foot wide sheets that are eight to 16 feet long and with thicknesses that vary from 1/4 in. (6.5 mm) to 1 1/8 in. (28.5 mm).</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-is-osb-made></span>How Is OSB Made?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Manufacturers produce OSB by tightly pressing together rectangular wood strands in crisscross patterns and combining them with glue or resin under high heat. According to the Engineered Wood Association (known by the acronym APA, since it used to be called the American Plywood Association), the manufacturing process produces “a solid panel product of consistent quality with no laps, gaps, or voids.”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-osb-used-for></span>What Is OSB Used For?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>OSB is primarily a structural material; builders mainly use it for wall and roof sheathing and subfloors. It also has several utility uses, including trailer liners and flooring for recreational vehicles. Some people even use it to make furniture, cabinets and even wall paneling.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-does-osb-cost></span>How Much Does OSB Cost?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>OSB is generally cheaper than plywood. Depending on thickness, a 4 X 8 sheet costs between $15 and $43.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=building-with-osb></span>Building With OSB<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><h4>Should I Run OSB Horizontally or Vertically?</h4><p>When installing OSB on a subfloor, the strength axis (the longer edge) should run perpendicular to the supporting framing. Vertical or horizontal is acceptable when installing it as sheathing unless a designer or engineer specifies a certain direction.</p><h4>Which Side of OSB Should Face Up?</h4><p>OSB has a rough, unfinished side and a smooth side with a thin, moisture-resistant finish. When installing on a roof or <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/article/basement-subfloor-panels/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">subfloor</a>, the rough side should be facing up to provide traction for walking. When installed on walls, the smooth side should face the studs and the rough side should face out. Sheets are usually marked on one side with a stamp that says “This Side Down.”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=pros-and-cons-of-osb></span>Pros and Cons of OSB<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><h4>Pros</h4><p>Most builders rate plywood and OBS equal in strength and durability, but OSB does have some advantages over plywood:</p><ul><li>It has a textured, slip-resistant surface, which makes it safer to install on roofs.</li><li>It often comes with pre-scribed lines at 16- and 24-inch intervals, which makes it easy to locate underlying studs and rafters for nailing.</li><li>Unlike plywood, which may have overlapping knots that undermine its strength, OSB is free of laps, gaps and voids.</li><li>OSB is available in longer sheets, which minimizes the number of joints that can leak.</li><li>OSB is manufactured from small, fast-growing trees, which makes it a sustainable forest product.</li></ul><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>Besides appearance, the main disadvantage of OSB is that the edges tend to swell when they get wet and remain swollen even after drying out. This results in ridges that can “telegraph” through shingles and even carpets when you use OSB as a subfloor.</li><li>OSB tends to be heavier than plywood. A 4X8 sheet of 3/4-inch sheet of OSB weighs 78 pounds while a comparable sheet of plywood weighs only 67 pounds.</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-plywood></span>What Is Plywood?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Plywood is another type of structural engineered wood panel. It comes in four-by-eight-, nine- and 10-foot sheets that range in thickness from 1/8 in. (3.2 mm) to 1 1/4 in (31.75 mm). It’s available in many appearance grades, “ranging from smooth, natural surfaces suitable for finish work to more economical grades used for sheathing,” according to the APA.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-is-plywood-made></span>How Is Plywood Made?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The APA explains that plywood is “manufactured from thin sheets of cross-laminated veneer and bonded under heat and pressure with strong adhesives.” The inner sheets are typically obtained from softwoods such as fir and pine. The face sheets may be softwood or a more decorative hardwood species.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-plywood-used-for></span>What Is Plywood Used For?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Because of its smooth surface, plywood has decorative and structural value. As Vergara puts it: “If you’re into the look of things, plywood tends to win on the aesthetics front with its smoother surface.” Lower grades of plywood are suitable for sheathing, subfloor and other construction purposes, while higher grades are used for cabinetry, wall paneling and other interior design applications.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-does-plywood-cost></span>How Much Does Plywood Cost?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>A sheet of plywood will set you back more than a comparable sheet of OSB, but the actual cost is highly dependent on grade, which ranges from A (cabinet grade) to D (utility grade). Plywood prices range from $4.50 to $10 per square foot.</p><h4>Why is plywood more expensive than OSB?</h4><p>Plywood is manufactured according to more exacting standards than OSB, and the raw materials are generally sourced from high-quality logs. On the other hand, the wood chips used to make OSB come from smaller-diameter, faster-growing trees, and some may come from recycled materials.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=pros-and-cons-of-plywood></span>Pros and Cons of Plywood<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>Because it comes in decorative as well as utility grades, plywood has more uses than OSB. Higher grades can be stained and finished just like wood.</li><li>The smooth face of plywood makes a better subfloor surface for laying tiles.</li><li>Plywood tends to be about 10 percent stiffer than OSB and is better at holding nails.</li></ul><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>Plywood can delaminate when exposed to moisture for a prolonged period.</li><li>When left in the rain, unused plywood sheets can warp.</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=osb-vs-plywood-which-is-better></span>OSB vs. Plywood: Which Is Better?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The main reason for choosing OSB is the cost. Its lower price can generate big savings in a large construction project. For example, as sheathing and subfloor materials, plywood and OSB are essentially equivalent, but the lower cost of OSB makes it more cost-effective in those areas.</p><p>When it comes to cabinetry, furniture and other designer uses, the smooth face of plywood is the preferred material.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=faq></span>FAQ<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-mix-osb-and-plywood></span>Can you mix OSB and plywood?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Mixing OSB and plywood in the same application generally isn’t recommended. Sheet thicknesses aren’t always the same, making it difficult to match edges and get leak-proof seams.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=osb-vs-plywood-which-is-more-water-resistant></span>OSB vs. Plywood: Which is more water-resistant?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Plywood absorbs moisture faster than OSB, but it also dries out more quickly, and it isn’t prone to edge swelling.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=osb-vs-plywood-which-warps-more></span>OSB vs. Plywood: Which warps more?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Because it’s manufactured from full sheets of veneer, plywood tends to warp more than OSB, but this tendency decreases with the increasing number of alternating layers.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sources></span>Sources<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p63MoqOyoJGjsbq5wKdlnKedZL2zu8memq1nn6e2prrTnptmq6Snrq%2BwjJummqqUYsO0ec%2BlsLCnn5l8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2foriented-strand-board-vs-plywood.html&text=OSB%20vs.%20Plywood%3a%20Which%20One%20Is%20Better%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2foriented-strand-board-vs-plywood.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2foriented-strand-board-vs-plywood.html&title=OSB%20vs.%20Plywood%3a%20Which%20One%20Is%20Better%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2foriented-strand-board-vs-plywood.html&title=OSB%20vs.%20Plywood%3a%20Which%20One%20Is%20Better%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2foriented-strand-board-vs-plywood.html&title=OSB%20vs.%20Plywood%3a%20Which%20One%20Is%20Better%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2foriented-strand-board-vs-plywood.html&description=OSB%20vs.%20Plywood%3a%20Which%20One%20Is%20Better%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./need-for-speed-payback-list-cars.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Need for Speed Payback Shares Full List of Cars">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jennifer-brena-ferguson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet Devo Keenan  Photos Of Maynard James Keenans Son ">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
