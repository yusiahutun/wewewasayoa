Hill is not spotted nor associated with any females currently. Nonetheless, Conleth openly has made no statements about his previous relationships as well. On the screen, Hill is seen being linked with several girls but it is just opposite on the off-screen.</p><p>Likewise, Hill also has a good relationship with his co-actresses but there are no news and rumors of him dating any girl.
