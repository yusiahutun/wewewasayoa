Instead, the season opener just got really weird with it. Talking chickens, rock flute, and Kate McKinnon full-on giving Ryan Gosling a rimjob were just some of the things that made almost every performer break at one point or another. This&nbsp;episode was the giggliest I’ve ever seen, and I’ve seen the Best of Jimmy Fallon compilation.

Baldwin’s Trump impression has been </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>dividing</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, to say the least, but I’m interested in how he’s really ramped up the facial contortions. Baldwin squints his eyes away and twists his mouth to the point that he looks more like a </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Francis Bacon painting</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> than a man. This cold open suffered a little from trying to be too many sketches at the same time. Was it about Puerto Rico? Or the theory that Trump is intentionally stressing out America? When Aidy Bryant’s Sarah Huckabee Sanders guesses that Trump declared war on North Korea four months ago, Trump interjects “Wrong! It was last Friday. See? I’m bending time.” Or was it just an excuse for everybody to get their political impressions on the table early in the season? Kate McKinnon was delightful as racist Keebler elf Jeff Sessions, though she appeared to have some trouble talking around the fake teeth. And Alex Moffat’s Chuck Schumer was really funny, but why was he there? The sketch seemed to be saying that Schumer is colluding with Trump in his plan to destroy our mental health, but shouldn’t that be its own sketch?</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3uh9l0qwkzjmcbxqvf08a@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3uh9l0qwlzjmcyvijjbsj@published data-word-count=1><b>Monologue</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3uh9l0qwmzjmc66zhv8br@published data-word-count=120><span style=font-weight:400>There were two constants in Ryan Gosling’s performance: breaking, and wearing shirts that I want.

It was most likely intentional on the part of wardrobe, because the lion’s share of Gosling’s monologue was about how he Saved Jazz with that movie. He chastens the band for jazzing too loud, because “If you play jazz that loud, then people can’t hear me talk about jazz.” Emma Stone made the second cameo of the night, reminding Gosling that he didn’t Save Jazz—they both did.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3uh9l0qwnzjmcnzx1k858@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3uh9l0qwozjmcnew6f6mn@published data-word-count=3><b>Close Encounter 2</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3uh9l0qwpzjmckpwn9lrw@published data-word-count=110><span style=font-weight:400>This is the sequel to a previous sketch Ryan Gosling couldn’t stop laughing in </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>two years ago</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>. Once again Gosling and Cecily Strong have been abducted by benevolent aliens, who want to show them the meaning of life and why we’re all here. Meanwhile Kate McKinnon’s character keeps getting hit in the breasts by tiny grey weirdos. This time, they also tried to punch her butt back together, since the aliens have never seen a butt before and think something is wrong. This is where the rimjob came into play. All the weird butt stuff the aliens did to McKinnon, McKinnon did to Gosling.

Tired of being labeled “man” or “woman” or “child” by their clothes, young hip persyns are promoting Woke Jeans, a genderless pant of indeterminate color with no pockets and a zipper that goes all the way from front to butt. Sporting the jeans were new cast members Heidi Gardner and Chris Redd, as well as Ryan Gosling in a jacket I would very much like. This parody wouldn’t have been nearly as effective without the spot-on editing. The timing between jokes and people just shouting “WOKE!” was perfect. Also, those pants are barely parody. In LA, “barf-colored genderless sack” is definitely a Look. Sufficiently advanced parody is indistinguishable from the thing being mocked.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3uh9l0qwtzjmctrm7vu9f@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3uh9l0qwuzjmc9sd5knl4@published data-word-count=1><b>Fliplets</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3uh9l0qwvzjmc7ibnmxn6@published data-word-count=120><span style=font-weight:400>This sketch started with the fact that there is a third, </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>unsung Property Brother</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, and played a game of “If this is true, what else?” Why would two of three brothers go into real estate and home renovation, leaving one brother to warp into a shunned emotional husk of a person? “When I was 12, I watched a man get hit by a bus,” says Gosling’s non-property brother Tristan. “Some might say that was the day the light inside me dimmed, but I would say that was the moment the darkness began to shine.” My favorite part of the sketch was the audience’s reaction to Tristan, the upsetting brother.

When I saw Aidy Bryant dressed as a chicken/gun moll I legit checked my phone to see if there was still 1/3 of an episode left. Bryant plays a talking chicken in a black-and-white film noir who’s helping the man she loves hide from the police. Gosling’s bank robber has been lying to his chicken girlfriend about lots of things: that they’re going to run away together, that airplanes have egg incubators, and that he doesn’t already have a wife. But he takes the fall for her when she accidentally shoots Kenan Thompson’s innocent bystander. It was true love all along. The sketch then cuts to 20 years later, where the chicken is waiting for Gosling to get out of lockup. For some reason, the chicken is so much funnier in color.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3uh9l0qx6zjmc0g8tq681@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3uh9l0qx7zjmcvbtmcoo5@published data-word-count=2><b>Pizza Hut</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3uh9l0qx8zjmcpn3z9vt5@published data-word-count=96><span style=font-weight:400>Do you remember those Pizza Hut commercials where they tricked people into thinking they were taste testing a fine Italian eatery, but really they were sampling Pizza Hut’s new spaghetti or whatever?

The couple spirals quickly, and Gosling threatens violence on everyone who ever tricked him into thinking he was dining at Terrazano’s, a restaurant&nbsp;that doesn’t exist yet Strong keeps insisting is her favorite.

During the “let me introduce you to the band” segment, Thompson keeps asking questions about Gosling’s salacious love life. The poor flutist tries to bring the show back to the music, but even the audience is more emotionally invested in whatever is going on with Gosling. The whole sketch—and premiere episode—culminates with Leslie Jones ripping a pair of jeans in half while everybody tries not to laugh. It’s the only thing she did live in the episode, and she crushed it. If this what’s in store for season 43, I’m down. I’m very much looking forward to hiding from the world in this nonsense for the next year.</span></p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Ryan Gosling Giggles His Way Through the ‘SNL’ Season […]</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlocGdhZXyzxcCnZKCno6G2r7OMoKCgn5yawG60yKxksJmpYsGpvs6unqFlpJ2ybr%2FNpWSsnZGovK95z6ucpqGVp7JvtNOmow%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fryan-gosling-giggles-his-way-through-the-snl-season-premiere-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fryan-gosling-giggles-his-way-through-the-snl-season-premiere-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fryan-gosling-giggles-his-way-through-the-snl-season-premiere-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fryan-gosling-giggles-his-way-through-the-snl-season-premiere-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fryan-gosling-giggles-his-way-through-the-snl-season-premiere-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fryan-gosling-giggles-his-way-through-the-snl-season-premiere-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./stealing-angels-tayla-lynn-married.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./stealing-angels-tayla-lynn-married.html>Stealing Angels Tayla Lynn Marries in Italy</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./keeping-music-alive.html>Keeping the music alive - YP</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./keeping-music-alive.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
