Complete with stellar, updated animation and a sense of humor consistent with the original 2001 series, the show still remains a story about family, friendship, and acceptance. Since the <a href=#>Disney+</a> original series proved to be a successful revival to both new critics and old fans, a second season for the hit show seemed more than justified. Thankfully, production on a sophomore outing was announced before Louder and Prouder's freshman run even began.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, while the animation, writing, and directing are vital and essential aspects of the show's success, what most probably really remember The Proud Family for is its lovable cast of characters. The 2022 revival featured the return of a huge amount of cast members from the original show, while also introducing some brand-new faces to the series with some big names lending their voices to them. There are also a number of <a href=#>special guest stars</a> who will be voicing some new and returning characters for the second season this time around. In case you need a refresher of who's who in the hit series, here is a cast and character guide to the members and friends of the famous Proud Family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/proud-family-louder-and-prouder-season-2-cast.jpg><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="9 Disney+ Shows to Watch if You Liked 'The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder'">9 Disney+ Shows to Watch if You Liked 'The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder'</a></span></p><h2 id=kyla-pratt-as-penny-proud>Kyla Pratt as Penny Proud</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/proud-family-louder-and-prouder-season-2-penny-proud.jpg><p>Though The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder is very much an ensemble cast, Penny Proud has always been the face of the series and the lead character, so it seemed only appropriate that <strong>Kyla Pratt</strong> (One on One) return to voice the role. While she, like her friends, faced a bit of a growth spurt in the first episode of Louder and Prouder, Penny is still the same rebellious teenager trying to live her life to the fullest. That goal can prove to be a bit difficult when her overprotective father Oscar consistently gets in the way of her living her life, she's also often supported by her more worldly and accepting mother Trudy. Penny in more ways than one is the <a href=#>perfect teenage protagonist</a>. She often succumbs to many temptations and vices that teenagers today are often faced with, but ultimately she has an unerring sense of right and wrong and always does the right thing in the end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tommy-davidson-as-oscar-proud>Tommy Davidson as Oscar Proud</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/proud-family-louder-and-prouder-oscar-and-suga-mama.jpg><p>Oscar Proud has easily become one of the most iconic performances of comedian <strong>Tommy Davidson</strong> (In Living Color), so it absolutely had to be Davidson to voice the role. Oscar's main career passion is his desire to craft his own snack food empire, even making his own snack-themed amusement park in the previous season. When he's not coming up with snack-food innovations, Oscar is trying to navigate the minefield that is raising a teenager. His approach is far more strict and heavy-handed (unless whatever thing Penny is doing that he disapproves of has some positive outcome for him), but Trudy is often the voice of reason when he constantly tries to control Penny's life. Still, it all comes from a place of love, and Oscar probably is just overprotective of Penny given he's constantly arguing with his own parent, Suga Momma. Whatever his family members do to make him want to pull his hair out, Oscar always ultimately proves that his heart is in the right place and will always be motivated by his love for his family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jo-marie-payton-as-suga-mama>Jo Marie Payton as Suga Mama</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-proud-family-louder-and-prouder-season-2-suga-mama.jpg><p>Easily in the top ten television grandmothers of all time, <a href=#><strong>Jo Marie Payton</strong>'s Suga Mama</a> is arguably the most popular member of the Proud Family. Armed with a tough-as-nails attitude and her trusty canine sidekick Puff, Suga Mama doesn't put up with any form of nonsense, especially when the source of that nonsense is her son, Oscar. She might not look like the most understanding person in the household, but she would do anything for her grandchildren and her angel son Bobby Proud. Plus, even though Oscar drives her crazy sometimes, she'll even come to his defense too, such as when an angry bull tries to push around Oscar in the trailer for Season 2.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bresha-webb-and-aiden-dodson-as-cece-and-bebe-proud>Bresha Webb and Aiden Dodson as CeCe and BeBe Proud</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-proud-family-louder-and-prouder-cece-bebe.jpg><p>The twin babies of the family (even though it's been years since the original show), CeCe (<strong>Bresha Webb</strong>) and BeBe (<strong>Aiden Dodson</strong>) are always getting up to something. Most of the time that something is being little angels for their mom Trudy and adorable tormentors to their father, Oscar. In one moment of the new trailer, not only do Penny and her friends get a Disney princess makeover, CeCe and BeBe also show off some new Disney-themed attire with pajamas that look like Nala and Simba from <a href=#><strong>The Lion King</strong></a> (1994).</p><h2 id=paula-jai-parker-as-trudy-proud>Paula Jai Parker as Trudy Proud</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-proud-family-louder-and-prouder-penny-trudy.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Where Oscar is more selfish and overbearing, Paula Jai Parker's (Friday) Trudy is far more empathetic and relaxed. This makes sense given Oscar is a businessman and Trudy is a veterinarian, so the matriarch of the Proud household has far more experience taking a gentler approach to things. She's the voice of reason for the entire family. Whenever there is a conflict that the other members of the house don't seem to be able to solve, Trudy is there whenever Oscar yells out her name.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="'The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder' Trailer Boasts Stylized Animation for Disney+ Revival">'The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder' Trailer Boasts Stylized Animation for Disney+ Revival</a></span></p><h2 id=alisa-reyes-as-lacienega-boulevardez>Alisa Reyes as LaCienega Boulevardez</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-proud-family-louder-and-prouder-lacienega.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Penny's first member of her friend group is hardly her closest, as <strong>Alisa Reyes</strong> (<a href=#>All That</a>) as her neighbor LaCienega Boulevardez isn't really the nicest to her.

LaCienega is constantly trying to one-up Penny, repeatedly attacking her appearance and referring to her as "Proud" in virtually every single episode she's in. However, despite her being constantly rude to Penny, she still is accepted by the group, and they still get along well for the most part.</p><h2 id=cedric-the-entertainer-as-bobby-proud>Cedric the Entertainer as Bobby Proud</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-proud-family-louder-and-prouder-bobby-penny-zoey.jpg><p>Suga Mama's favorite son, <a href=#><strong>Cedric the Entertainer</strong></a> (Barbershop) returns as the musically inclined Bobby Proud. Bobby got something of a makeover for the revival, ditching his wardrobe inspired by the artist formerly known as <strong>Prince </strong>and taking on some much more modern clothing. However, just because his appearance might be different doesn't mean his personality has changed. Yes, Bobby is still singing every word that comes out of his mouth, even though the unenlightened don't fully appreciate his musical talents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=maria-canals-barrera-and-carlos-mencia-as-sunset-and-felix-boulevardez>Maria Canals-Barrera and Carlos Mencia as Sunset and Felix Boulevardez</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-proud-family-louder-and-prouder-sunset-and-felix.jpg><p>Though LaCienega may have a "frenemy" type of relationship with the Proud family, the same can't be said for her parents.

She really becomes much more of her own person in Louder and Prouder, since the boy she was obsessed with in the previous show, Sticky, has now moved away.</p><h2 id=soleil-moon-frye-as-zoey-howzer>Soleil Moon Frye as Zoey Howzer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-proud-family-louder-and-prouder-zoey.jpg><p>The brains of the friend group, Zoey (<a href=#><strong>Soleil Moon Frye</strong></a>) has gone through quite the growth spurt since the 2001 show.

In the 2001 series, Zoey felt that her personal appearance was lacking as compared to others. Thankfully, with the help of Penny (and even LaCienega), she has a consistent support system to boost her confidence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="The Best Animated Movies on Disney+ Right Now">The Best Animated Movies on Disney+ Right Now</a></span></p><h2 id=e-j-johnson-as-michael-collins>E.J.

Michael was once an incredibly minor side character in the show, first showing up for cheerleading tryouts in the first scene of the first episode. He's come a long way since then, getting a whole new look, becoming a full-fledged member of Penny's friend group, and being the first of several characters in the show to be an <a href=#>open member of the LGBTQIA+ community</a>, which is fitting of a show that has always been praised for tackling honest representation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=keke-palmer-as-maya-leibowitz-jenkins>Keke Palmer as Maya Leibowitz-Jenkins</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-proud-family-louder-and-prouder-maya.jpg><p>The first new major character to join the Proud Family universe, <a href=#><strong>Keke Palmer</strong></a> (Nope) appears as someone who took a little while to warm up to Penny Proud.

Maya isn't interested, as she thinks Penny is just another teenage girl who has no interest in doing anything meaningful or important in her life. Eventually, she does see that Penny is a good-hearted person who can be trusted, and she also becomes a regular member of the group.</p><h2 id=artist-quot-a-boogie-quot-dubose-as-k-g-leibowitz-jenkins>Artist "A Boogie" Dubose as K.G.

Randall is the manager at the town bank and Barry is a police officer along with Sunset Boulevardez, and the third episode of Louder and Prouder takes a deep look into the two's relationship and how they're initially ostracized by their neighbors and their kids are harassed at school. However, eventually, everyone in the community sees that Randall, Barry, and their kids are marvelously kind and pleasant people to be around, and fully accept them for who they are.
