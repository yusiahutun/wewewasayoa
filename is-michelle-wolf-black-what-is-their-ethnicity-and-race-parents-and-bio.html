Aschenbrener and they were all related to being German.&nbsp;This could open up the possibility that Michelle is German, although we can’t draw a conclusion at this point.</span></p><p><span>Micheal’s maternal parents were Ohio-born Helen Pauline Shingle Decker and Pennsylvania-born Fredrick James Maier.&nbsp;Fredrick’s parents are also said to be of German descent.</span></p><p><span>Michelle’s immediate parents could have given us a perfect link to their actual origins, but unfortunately there is no record of who they are, where they lived/lived, worked and possibly what they are doing now.</span></p><h2><strong><span>body</span><span>&nbsp;measurements</span></strong></h2><p><span>Michelle is not a super hot girl, she has skin rashes on her face and lots of spots.&nbsp;She’s practically not too big a person either.&nbsp;She is 5 ft 5 inches and weighs 56 kg.&nbsp;The comic star wears her hair a golden color and has black eyes.&nbsp;Her other body measurements are 32-28-34 i.e. waist, chest and hips.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Networth</span></strong></h2><p><span>The comic star practically did not get out of the theatrical world in time, she managed to make a good career as an entertainer.&nbsp;The comedian has a net worth of $1.5 million.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiho2K6qq%2FHnqOlnV2svK2yjJujmpubYsSprdNmoKxlpJ2yqr6MnquhppmYtrXFjJqlnWWilrCmec%2BaqZ6mpKh6orrDZpmip18%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-michelle-wolf-black-what-is-their-ethnicity-and-race-parents-and-bio.html&text=Is%20Michelle%20Wolf%20Black%3fWhat%20is%20their%20ethnicity%20and%20race%3fparents%20and%20bio&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-michelle-wolf-black-what-is-their-ethnicity-and-race-parents-and-bio.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-michelle-wolf-black-what-is-their-ethnicity-and-race-parents-and-bio.html&title=Is%20Michelle%20Wolf%20Black%3fWhat%20is%20their%20ethnicity%20and%20race%3fparents%20and%20bio" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-michelle-wolf-black-what-is-their-ethnicity-and-race-parents-and-bio.html&title=Is%20Michelle%20Wolf%20Black%3fWhat%20is%20their%20ethnicity%20and%20race%3fparents%20and%20bio" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-michelle-wolf-black-what-is-their-ethnicity-and-race-parents-and-bio.html&title=Is%20Michelle%20Wolf%20Black%3fWhat%20is%20their%20ethnicity%20and%20race%3fparents%20and%20bio" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-michelle-wolf-black-what-is-their-ethnicity-and-race-parents-and-bio.html&description=Is%20Michelle%20Wolf%20Black%3fWhat%20is%20their%20ethnicity%20and%20race%3fparents%20and%20bio" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kristen-bell-extremely-rare-photo-daughters-dax-shepard.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kristen Bell shares extremely rare photo of daughters with Dax Shepard">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./cooking-oil-theft-sting-nets-2-arrests-in-riverhead-d.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cooking Oil Theft Sting Nets 2 Arrests In Riverhead d">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
