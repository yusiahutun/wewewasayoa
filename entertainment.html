<time>31 Jan 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>If you think back on your favorite movies of the ’80s, you’re likely to picture the eight faces that made up what was known as the “Brat Pack”: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Emilio Estevez</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Anthony Michael Hall</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rob Lowe</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew McCarthy</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Molly Ringwald</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Demi Moore</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Judd Nelson</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ally Sheedy</a>. These young actors dominated the film scene throughout the ’80s, and were coined the Brat Pack by New York magazine journalist David Blum, who after spending time with Estevez, Lowe and Nelson wrote <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an infamous article</a> that gave a snapshot of the debauchery that came with their youthful fame. While most of the members of the so-called Brat Pack weren’t fans of the label and the somewhat negative connotations that came with it, they’ve gone on to be regarded as celebrity icons from the decade.</p><p>The two films that cemented one’s status as part of the Brat Pack were St. Elmo’s Fire and <a href=#>The Breakfast Club</a>, both of which were released in 1985 and captured the zeitgeist thanks to their charismatic young casts. Other films in the canon include <a href=#>The Outsiders</a> (1983), Sixteen Candles (1984) and Pretty in Pink (1986). Decades after they first hit the screen, the Brat Pack actors are Hollywood veterans. Here’s a look at how the ’80s stars rose to fame, and what they’ve been up to in recent years.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The “Brat Pack” then and now</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Emilio Estevez</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/Copy-of-side-by-side-2024-01-23T162942.261.png><p>Emilio Estevez was destined to be in showbiz, as his dad is actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Sheen</a>. Throughout the ’80s, Estevez could be seen starring in popular films including The Outsiders, The Breakfast Club and St. Elmo’s Fire.</p><p>In 1986, Estevez added directing and screenwriting to his resume with Wisdom, which he also starred in. He continued writing, directing and starring in movies in 1990 with Men at Work, and directed and starred in the films Rated X (2000), Bobby (2006), The Way (2010) and The Public (2018) in the ’00s and ’10s. Estevez also starred in the classic 1992 sports film The Mighty Ducks, as well as its 1994 and 1996 sequels. Most recently, he returned to the hockey franchise in The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers TV show in 2021.</p><p>Now 61, Estevez, like many of his peers, has mixed feelings about the Brat Pack label. In 2020, he quipped to The Guardian, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">That [term] will be on my tombstone</a>,”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Anthony Michael Hall</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/Copy-of-side-by-side-2024-01-23T163217.902.png><p>Anthony Michael Hall was the go-to for playing nerdy characters in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Hughes</a> films like Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club and Weird Science (1985).</p><p>Following these teen movie classics, Hall joined the cast of Saturday Night Live for a season at age 17 in 1985. As the ’90s came around, Hall sought to avoid typecasting and appeared in movies like Edward Scissorhands (1990) and Six Degrees of Separation (1993), and branched into directing with the 1994 comedy Hail Caesar (1994), which he also starred in.</p><p>In the ’00s and beyond Hall took on roles in more serious films, including The Dark Knight (2008), Foxcatcher (2014), Live by Night (2016) and War Machine (2017). More recently, he’s appeared in movies like Halloween Kills (2021) and The Class (2022) and shown up in multiple episodes of The Goldbergs and Bosch: Legacy.</p><p>Now 55, Hall told The Independent, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fame was off-putting and kind of scary</a>.” “It’s not unlike a horror movie,” he said. “When celebrity hits you, all of a sudden people are staring at you and looking at you in odd ways. Even though I was just a pubescent teenager, suddenly I was thrown into this world of show business. You don’t know what people are thinking, people are whispering about you, and it’s a strange thing to have to adjust to.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rob Lowe</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/Copy-of-side-by-side-2024-01-23T163707.875.png><p>One of the biggest heartthrobs of the ’80s, Rob Lowe rose to prominence in movies like The Outsiders, Oxford Blues (1984), St. Elmo’s Fire and About Last Night (1986).</p><p>As the ’90s rolled around, Lowe acted in Bad Influence (1990), Wayne’s World (1992) and the Austin Powers franchise.

He then acted in the family drama Brothers & Sisters from 2006 to 2011 and the sitcom Parks and Recreation from 2010 to 2015. Currently, Lowe stars in the procedural 9-1-1: Lone Star.</p><p>In an interview with People, Lowe, now 59, looked back on his rapid transition from regular teen to teen idol, remembering, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I was in Santa Monica High School</a>, and I really had to pick who I would invite to the junior prom because I didn’t want to get turned down; a year later, people were breaking into my house and stealing my underwear.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Andrew McCarthy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/Copy-of-side-by-side-2024-01-23T164146.801.png><p>Andrew McCarthy acted in films like St. Elmo’s Fire, Pretty in Pink, Mannequin (1987), Less Than Zero (1987) and Weekend at Bernie’s (1989).</p><p>McCarthy continued appearing in movies, among them The Joy Luck Club (1993) and Mulholland Falls (1996), throughout the ’90s, and since the ’00s he’s been in the cast of shows like Lipstick Jungle, The Family, Good Girls and The Resident.</p><p>Outside of acting, McCarthy is an accomplished director who has helmed episodes of Gossip Girl, The Blacklist and Orange Is the New Black. He’s also worked as a travel journalist and written multiple books, including a young adult novel and a memoir. In 2023, he wrote <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Walking With Sam: A Father, a Son, and Five Hundred Miles Across Spain</a>, a book about traveling with his son.</p><p>Now 61, McCarthy told People in 2021 that when it came to being in the Brat Pack, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The term was cast in a very pejorative way</a>. And the last thing you want in Hollywood is to be boxed in.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Judd Nelson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/Copy-of-side-by-side-2024-01-23T164938.484.png><p>Judd Nelson appeared in St. Elmo’s Fire, The Breakfast Club, Blue City (1986) and Relentless (1989) in the ’80s.</p><p>In the ’90s Nelson acted in New Jack City (1991), Airheads (1994) and Steel (1997) and costarred in the sitcom Suddenly Susan from 1996 to 1999. The ’00s and ’10s brought roles in shows like Las Vegas, Psych, Two and a Half Men, Nikita and Empire. He’s also appeared in Hallmark and Lifetime TV movies. Most recently, he had roles in Save Christmas (2022), The Most Dangerous Game (2022) and Dante’s Hotel (2023).</p><p>Now 64, when asked in a 2019 interview if he ever gets sick of talking about The Breakfast Club, Nelson said, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">No, not at all, man</a>. It’s like riding a fast horse, you know what I mean? All you gotta do is not fall off.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Demi Moore</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/Copy-of-side-by-side-2024-01-23T164652.521.png><p>Demi Moore started out as a soap star on General Hospital and earned her Brat Pack title when she acted in St. Elmo’s Fire and About Last Night.</p><p>In the ’90s, she became Hollywood’s highest-paid actress, starring in Ghost (1990), A Few Good Men (1992), Indecent Proposal (1993), Disclosure (1994), Striptease (1996) and G.I. Jane (1997).</p><p>Some of Moore’s films since the ’00s include Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle (2003), Margin Call (2011), Songbird (2020) and The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent (2022).

She also appeared in the popular Kissing Booth teen movie franchise on Netflix.</p><p>Now 55, Ringwald most recently starred in the 2024 miniseries Feud: Capote vs. the Swans.

I felt all the things that other teenagers felt. I was insecure in lots of ways, over-confident in others. I was very emotional.
