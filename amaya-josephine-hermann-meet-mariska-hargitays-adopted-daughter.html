<time>09 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Amaya Josephine Hermann is the daughter of well-known celebrities Mariska Hargitay and Peter Hermann. Mariska Hargitay is an actress known for her “Law and Order: SVU” role, while Peter Hermann is also an actor. The couple first met on the set of the show.</p><p>After having their first biological child, Mariska and Peter decided to adopt, and Amaya became a treasured addition to their family. Despite living away from the public eye most of her life, Amaya’s personality has already profoundly impacted her mother.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Capture-fotor-20230708121520.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Amaya_Josephine_Hermanns_Mother></span>Who Is Amaya Josephine Hermann’s Mother?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Amaya’s mother is the actress, Mariska Hargitay. Mariska was deeply affected by the loss of her mother when she was three due to a car accident, which left her without a maternal figure. A stepmother and half-siblings raised her. Having experienced the absence of a nurturing mother figure, Mariska had a profound understanding of the importance of family.</p><p>Her personal experiences and empathy for children separated from their biological parents and lacking access to basic needs motivated her to pursue adoption. Mariska believed that family goes beyond biology and that there are various ways to create a family. For her, the bond and connection between individuals truly define a family.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Amaya_Josephine_Hermanns_Birth></span>Amaya Josephine Hermann’s Birth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2011, Mariska Hargitay and Peter Hermann joyfully welcomed their daughter, Amaya, into their family. Amaya was born in the United States, bringing immense happiness to her parents. Hargitay, who was 47 then, described Amaya as alert and filled with love from birth.</p><p>Before adopting Amaya, Mariska and Peter considered domestic and international adoption. They were delighted to have their prayers answered with the arrival of their American-born child. The couple discussed mixed-race adoptions and were thrilled to embrace their new life as a multi-racial family.</p><p>Mariska Hargitay vividly remembered the day of Amaya’s birth, as she was present in the delivery room alongside her husband. Amaya’s mum emotionally shared that she was the one who “pulled Amaya out” during the birth process.</p><p>A significant and profoundly touching moment occurred following Amaya’s arrival when her adoptive parents and birth mother embraced in a long hug. Mariska described this experience as profound and one of the most meaningful moments of her life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Capture-fotor-2023070812191.jpg><p>At Amaya’s adoption, their son, <a href=#>August Hermann</a>, was four years old and highly excited about having a sister. Mariska shared that he affectionately called Amaya Josephine Hermann “his baby” and was the one who initially suggested that they expand their family.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Amaya_Josephine_Hermanns_Parents_Meet></span>How Did Amaya Josephine Hermann’s Parents Meet?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mariska and Peter initially met on the set of the popular series “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,” where Hermann appeared in 2002 and continued his role as Trevor Langan. Their onscreen chemistry translated into a real-life connection, and they tied the knot in 2004.&nbsp;</p><p>While Mariska and Peter preferred to keep their personal lives private, Mariska opened up in 2018 about balancing work and motherhood challenges. She emphasized the importance of being fully present in whichever role she was in, whether at work or with her children, striving to find a harmonious balance between the two.&nbsp;</p><p>Mariska Hargitay disclosed that there were days when she couldn’t see Amaya Josephine Hermann and her brothers, and during those times, she would find herself in tears. The longing to be with her children was so strong that she contemplated ending filming her successful series.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Amaya_Josephine_Hermanns_Siblings></span>Amaya Josephine Hermann’s Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Amaya’s older brother, August Miklos Friedrich Hermann, was born on June 28, 2006. Mariska had a challenging pregnancy with August, experiencing immobility and being diagnosed with gestational diabetes during her third trimester. Ultimately, she underwent an emergency C-section.</p><p>After the arrival of Amaya, her parents decided to expand their family through adoption once again. They adopted their youngest child, Andrew Nicolas Hargitay Hermann, born on October 19, 2011. Andrew’s adoption was a delightful surprise to the couple, as they were accustomed to the lengthy adoption process.</p><p>Amaya’s older brother demonstrated a protective nature toward her even at a young age. Mariska mentioned that he would always talk about caring for Amaya and being the best big brother.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Capture-fotor-20230708122433.jpg><p>Amaya’s older brother’s protective nature influenced her, and she developed a fearlessness in standing up for her youngest brother, Andrew. At just two years old, Amaya confronted a playground bully giving Andrew a hard time. She bravely faced the bully and defended her brother.</p><p>Mariska was immensely proud of her daughter’s strength and determination, witnessing Amaya’s refusal to back down even when the bully pushed her. Mariska considered her children her “teachers,” and she found Amaya’s resilience, independence, and assertiveness inspiring.</p><p>For Mariska, family is more than blood; it’s about bonding and connection, and she isn’t the only mother with an adoptive daughter of mixed race. <a href=#>Madonna</a> also adopted a beautiful daughter from Malawi.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51krq6t2Jpko6ejmr2ptc2eZKGdoqKur7qMppyerF2irrO10qSYZqCRp7SqwMCyqmaZlKS9tbHDZpuarZedwaa%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2famaya-josephine-hermann-meet-mariska-hargitays-adopted-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2famaya-josephine-hermann-meet-mariska-hargitays-adopted-daughter.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2famaya-josephine-hermann-meet-mariska-hargitays-adopted-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2famaya-josephine-hermann-meet-mariska-hargitays-adopted-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2famaya-josephine-hermann-meet-mariska-hargitays-adopted-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2famaya-josephine-hermann-meet-mariska-hargitays-adopted-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./american-singer-hank-williams-jr-74-ties-knot-girlfriend-brandi-43-two-years-death-wife-mary-jane-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./american-singer-hank-williams-jr-74-ties-knot-girlfriend-brandi-43-two-years-death-wife-mary-jane-html.html>American singer Hank Williams Jr, 74, ties the knot with his girlfriend Brandi, 43, two years after</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kyle-singler.html>Who is Kyle Singler dating?
