He formerly served as the Boston Celtics’ assistant coach. According to insiders, Hardy, Jazz assistant Alex Jensen, Raptors assistant Adrian Griffin, and Celtics assistant Joe Mazzulla were the four finalists who met with ownership this week in Salt Lake City. Quin Snyder, who resigned earlier this month, was replaced by The Jazz after a thorough search that included at least 15 applicants, under the direction of new CEO Danny Ainge. In his eight seasons with Utah, which has a current six-year postseason streak but hasn’t progressed past the Western Conference semifinals in that time, Snyder had a 372-264 record after taking over a rebuilding squad.</p><p>Danny Ainge, the Jazz Utah’s new CEO, is leading a huge overhaul for the team. They made their first-ever choice of coaches for the basketball team. Quin Snyder had coached Jazz Utah for the previous eight years. Quin Snyder’s Snyder submission in June 2022 prompted the choice to start looking for a coach. Coaches were chosen based on a variety of factors. There were 15 coaches present in total. The participating coaches were prominent NBA coaches, former NBA head coaches, and assistant coaches connected to Jazz Utah. He assisted Celtics head coach Ime Udoka during the 2021–22 campaign.

In his 26 seasons, he has a regular-season record of 1,344-701 and has guided the team to five NBA championships, the most recent of which was in 2014.</p><p>The franchise has had difficulty over the last three seasons, finishing around the bottom of the Western Conference and missing the playoffs, despite the fact that San Antonio has experienced tremendous success under Popovich.
