Based on the iconic anime and manga by Eiichiro Oda, One Piece stars <strong>Iñaki Godoy</strong> as Monkey D. Luffy, an enthusiastic would-be pirate who dreams of recovering the legendary One Piece and becoming the King of the Pirates. His journey is full of unforeseen obstacles, dangerous enemies, and loyal friends. However, the adversities only increase his excitement and will to triumph.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One Piece condenses roughly a hundred of the anime's chapters into eight short episodes. However, it does so valiantly, maintaining the original's essence and most of its most famous characters. Luffy might be the show's star, but One Piece introduces many other great characters, some of which rank among the most likable in this exciting maritime story.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/one-piece-live-action-poster.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="One Piece (Live-Action)">One Piece (Live-Action)</a></h5>TV-14<p class=display-card-description><br>In a seafaring world, a young pirate captain sets out with his crew to attain the title of Pirate King, and to discover the mythical treasure known as 'One Piece.'</p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>August 31, 2023</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span>Iñaki Godoy , Mackenyu , <a data-id href=#>Emily Rudd</a> , McKinley Belcher III , Jacob Gibson , Taz Skylar</span> <strong>Main Genre</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Adventure</a></span> <strong>Seasons</strong> <span>1</span><h2 id=helmeppo><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Helmeppo</span></h2><h3 id=played-by-aidan-scott>Played by Aidan Scott</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aidan-scott-in-one-piece.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Episode 1 of One Piece</a> introduces Helmeppo, the son of the corrupt Captain Morgan, who exploits his father's fame and fearsome reputation. Despite coming from a powerful family, Helmeppo is quite ineffective, much like his father. After failing to stop Luffy, Zoro, and Nami from stealing the map to the Grand Line, Helmeppo joins the Marines, where his uselessness becomes even more apparent.</p><p>Although he starts the show as an unlikable jerk, <strong>Helmeppo changes throughout the season's eight episodes, thanks to his cadet training and his friendship with Koby</strong>. Helmeppo remains vain and somewhat brutish, but he stands up to Vice Admiral Garp to prevent him from arresting the Straw Hats and accepts Koby as a friend by the final episode. Now, that's character development.</p><h2 id=garp><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Garp</span></h2><h3 id=played-by-vincent-regan>Played by Vincent Regan</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/one-piece-4.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The season's primary antagonist, Garp is a resourceful and obstinate man obsessed with capturing Luffy, later revealed to be his grandson. Garp is responsible for Gol D. Roger's capture, and his motivations to capture Luffy are mostly powered by his fear that his grandson will grow up to become another Roger.</p><p>Garp's actions are antagonistic, but he never comes across as an actual villain. Stubborn, yes, but not criminal or cruel. <strong>Garp's animosity toward pirates stems more from his commitment to order than any inherent dislike for them as people.</strong> Ultimately, Garp accepts that Luffy must follow his destiny as a pirate, even if the path sets them in opposite directions. Regan brings great nuance to Garp, making his actions seem understandable, if not necessarily excusable.</p><h2 id=buggy-the-clown><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Buggy the Clown</span></h2><h3 id=played-by-jeff-ward>Played by Jeff Ward</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jeff-ward-one-piece.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans of the One Piece anime and manga were surely thrilled to see Buggy the Clown in the Netflix adaptation. The deranged pirate is a recurring character in Season 1, acting as the main antagonist in Episode 2 and making several future appearances as a foe and reluctant ally of Luffy and his crew.</p><p><strong>Buggy is a surprisingly pleasant presence in One Piece</strong>. He is evil but not fearsome or loathsome; there is a morbidly entertaining quality to Buggy, thanks to Ward's larger-than-life performance and the character's innate showmanship. His macabre sense of humor and delightfully silly look make him a standout character in a show full of standouts. Buggy will surely <a href=#>return in One Piece Season 2</a>, bringing more of his deluded sense of entertainment with him.</p><h2 id=usopp><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Usopp</span></h2><h3 id=played-by-jacob-romero-gibson>Played by Jacob Romero Gibson</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/one-piece-netflix-jacob-romero-gibson-social-featured.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Usopp is a well-meaning but somewhat ineffective and cowardly young man who dreams of becoming a fearsome warrior of the sea to earn the respect and acknowledgment of his absent father. He has a deep connection with his childhood friend, Kaya, and spends his days warning his town about the impending arrival of pirates. However, they never arrive, giving Usopp an infamous reputation among his fellow villagers.</p><p><strong>Usopp is among <a href=#>the best side characters in anime</a> and an equally entertaining live-action figure</strong>. His boisterous personality can be somewhat frustrating, especially after a while and even more when he's drunk and lets his tongue run wild. However, once he joins Luffy's crew, Usopp becomes far more likable, supporting his friends and wowing them with his incredible and convenient inventions.</p><h2 id=chef-zeff><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Chef Zeff</span></h2><h3 id=played-by-craig-fairbrass>Played by Craig Fairbrass</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/craig-fairbass-one-piece.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chef Zeff is among the best characters in the One Piece live-action series. A former pirate who went by the name "Red Leg," Zeff is now retired and owns the Baratie, a luxurious floating restaurant where the Straw Hats first meet Sanji. Although he left his pirate days behind him, Zeff keeps the same fiery personality that made him notorious in the first place.</p><p>Zeff is <a href=#>among TV's best grumpy dads</a>. He is a father figure to Sanji, and the two share a loving, if confrontational, relationship. However, <strong>Zeff is a man of honor and courage, and his backstory with Sanji is arguably the show's most memorable and emotional storyline</strong>. Zeff's intervention is too short, but he will surely return should the show get renewed for a second season, and One Piece will be all the better for it.</p><h2 id=zoro><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Zoro</span></h2><h3 id=played-by-mackenyu>Played by Mackenyu</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/one-piece-netflix-mackenyu-social-featured.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Mackenyu</strong>, the son of the late martial arts icon <strong>Sonny Chiba</strong>, stars as Roronoa Zoro in Netflix's One Piece. Known as the "Pirate Hunter," Zoro is infamous across the four seas as a known killer of pirates. Zoro aims to become the world's greatest swordsman and excels in the "Three Swords Style."</p><p>Although quiet and stoic, Zoro is loyal, brave, and somewhat hot-headed. His dream to become the greatest swordsman sometimes makes him act before thinking, but he has the crew's best interest at heart. <strong>Zoro has all the makings of <a href=#>a great television fantasy hero</a>, and Mackenyu's committed, purposeful performance fits the character to a tee</strong>. The season's ending sees him embracing his role as Luffy's First Mate, even if he remains confused and often overwhelmed by his captain's overly enthusiastic persona.</p><h2 id=nami><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Nami</span></h2><h3 id=played-by-emily-rudd>Played by Emily Rudd</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/one-piece-emily-rudd-social-featured.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nami is One Piece's only major female character so far. A skilled thief with a tortuous past and a handful of secrets, she crosses paths with Luffy as they attempt to steal the Grand Line map. Nami reluctantly joins Luffy's crew, although it's always clear she's hiding something from the others.</p><p>Secretive and cynical, <strong>Nami lowers her guard with the Straw Hats, becoming a more caring and trustful person and developing genuine feelings for her new friends</strong>. A wonderfully layered character, Nami already ranks among <a href=#>the most badass women in fantasy TV</a>, and the character will only keep growing. She is crucial to the show's success, bringing some much-needed realism into the otherwise carefree crew. Rudd is outstanding in the role, especially whenever paired with <strong>Iñaki Godoy</strong> and Mackenyu.</p><h2 id=koby><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Koby</span></h2><h3 id=played-by-morgan-davies>Played by Morgan Davies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/morgan-davies-as-koby-in-netflix-s-one-piece.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kobi is the first friend Luffy makes in his adventure, a cabin boy imprisoned by the fearsome pirate Alvida. After Luffy releases him, Koby enlists with the Marines, forming a close bond with Vice Admiral Garp, who senses a kinship with him. He becomes a major supporting player throughout the season, struggling between his desire to become a Marine and his lingering friendship with Luffy.</p><p>Koby is the closest thing One Piece has to an audience surrogate. Like the viewers at home, he is as confused and marveled at the dazzling swashbuckling world around him. Although his commitment to the Marines remains steadfast, <strong>Koby grows in courage to the point where he openly defies Warp to stand up for Luffy</strong>. Koby is a sweet but brave young man, and Luffy is lucky to have him as a friend.</p><h2 id=sanji><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Sanji</span></h2><h3 id=played-by-taz-skylar>Played by Taz Skylar</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/one-piece-taz-skylar-social-featured.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The gifted cook Sanji debuts in Episode 5 of One Piece and quickly becomes one of the show's best characters. Charming and shamelessly flirtatious yet daring and somewhat cocky, Sanji is an instantly likable character with a unique fighting style and a killer fashion sense.</p><p><strong>The devilishly winning Sanji is among One Piece's most beloved characters</strong>, and the show receives a considerable boost once he joins the Straw Hats. His constant flirting with Nami and playful banter with Zoro are great, as is his constant encouragement of Luffy and Usopp. Sanji is as great in the live-action adaptation as he is in <a href=#>the widely adored One Piece anime</a> and a brilliant example of perfect casting. He would be the most likable character in the show if it weren't for the straw hat-wearing captain of the Going Merry.</p><h2 id=luffy><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Luffy</span></h2><h3 id=played-by-i-ntilde-aki-godoy>Played by Iñaki Godoy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/one-piece-luffy.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Iñaki Godoy is a perfect Luffy for the live-action adaptation of One Piece</strong>. The young Mexican actor is a revelation as the willful and happy-go-lucky pirate-in-the-making who dreams of assembling a crew and finding the One Piece to become King of the Pirates.</p><p>Charming, funny, sweet, and relatable, <strong>Luffy is everything a great protagonist should be</strong>. Godoy does a stellar job handling Luffy's colorful personality, showcasing his overwhelmingly positive outlook while preventing him from becoming obnoxious. Luffy's physicality is crucial to the show's success, especially considering the many fighting scenes, which do a wonderful job translating the anime's visual language into live action. Godoy is on his way to becoming <a href=#>one of Netflix's many breakout stars</a>, and his take on Luffy will surely become a modern icon of the revered streamer.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The 15 Best Netflix Characters, Ranked</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51kvK%2BxjKmgnpuVYrumwMWloLFlnZa2r3nCoZirmZOpsrO%2FjKuYp6OVmXqttcqamaKkmanGcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fone-piece-netflix-main-characters-ranked-likability.html&text=Netflix%27s%20%27One%20Piece%27%20Main%20Characters%2c%20Ranked%20by%20Likability&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fone-piece-netflix-main-characters-ranked-likability.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fone-piece-netflix-main-characters-ranked-likability.html&title=Netflix%27s%20%27One%20Piece%27%20Main%20Characters%2c%20Ranked%20by%20Likability" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fone-piece-netflix-main-characters-ranked-likability.html&title=Netflix%27s%20%27One%20Piece%27%20Main%20Characters%2c%20Ranked%20by%20Likability" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fone-piece-netflix-main-characters-ranked-likability.html&title=Netflix%27s%20%27One%20Piece%27%20Main%20Characters%2c%20Ranked%20by%20Likability" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fone-piece-netflix-main-characters-ranked-likability.html&description=Netflix%27s%20%27One%20Piece%27%20Main%20Characters%2c%20Ranked%20by%20Likability" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-follow-someone-on-facebook.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Follow Someone on Facebook">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./legendary-singer-jon-liebing-death-cause-family-mourns-the-loss.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Legendary Singer Jon Liebing Death Cause | Family Mourns The Loss">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
