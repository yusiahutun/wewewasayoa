I go about my day the same way anyone else would -in the same way, a heterosexual couple would go about their day. I wake up in the morning. I tell my wife I love her. I go to work. I come home. We cook dinner together. This is normal. As any husband would love his wife, or any wife would love her husband -that’s the same way I love LaTaya.”</p><img alt height=15 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com/data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" title="Click and drag to move" width=15 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Having lost her uterus to fibroids in 2010, she is left with a gestational surrogate as the only alternative to giving birth.
