After he graduated from high school, Beckham, who was rated as the number 6 wide receiver and the number 40 high school football player in the United States at the time, went to college at Louisiana State University, which he chose over scholarship offers from Ole Miss, the University of Nebraska, Tulane University and the University of Tulsa. Beckham played with Louisiana State University for three seasons. He decided to forgo his senior season to enter in the 2014 NFL Draft, where he was selected by the New York Giants as a wide receiver. He played with the Giants for four years before he was traded for the Cleveland Browns. Beckham played with the Browns for two years before he left the team for the Los Angeles Rams. He competed with the Rams at the <a href=# rel=noopener>Super Bowl LVI</a> in 2022, which saw the team compete against&nbsp;the Cincinnati Bengals.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/alicia-keys-super-bowl.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/justin-bieber-super-bowl-usher.jpg><p>In an interview with GQ in 2014, Beckham revealed that’s he’s considered retiring. “Twenty-four years old. Just off it. To love something so much to a place where it is my everything, and to watch it be tainted, or all kinds of things be in the middle of it. Like, it hurt me to my soul,” he said at the time. “It be like loving someone and putting them on such a level to where life is about them and you love that person through anything. Through the good, the bad. And to watch them do something so heinous and vulgar. Something just so, like, almost unforgivable. You still love them, but it’s, like, Wow.”</p><p>He continued, “Not to get on conspiracy-type talk, but there’s so much other stuff that goes on in the National Football League than football. It’s unreal. I said in college that I fear the day that they make the game I love a business and not just the game I love. And as I slowly, surely, seen that, it changed my heart about it. But then, at the same time, I have to feed my family. I have to set myself up for one day when I have kids—like, I need to set their future.”</p><p>So what is <a href=# rel=noopener>Odell Beckham Jr.’s net worth</a>?

Per Sportrac, Beckham Jr. has made a total of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">$81,896,476</a> in the NFL, which includes five seasons with the Giants, three seasons with the Browns and one season with the Rams.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">GQ</a> in 2019, Beckham opened up about what it was like to join the NFL in 2014. “I was always the underdog. I wasn’t the number one drafted receiver in my class, even though I wanted to be. I said I wanted to be a top-10 pick—I wasn’t, he said, “I said I wanted to win a Heisman in college—I didn’t. At LSU, I wanted to win a national championship. I got there and we got blown out. And then I was like, I have to win Rookie of the Year. There’s no ifs, ands, or buts. I have to win Rookie of the Year. I pulled my hamstring, and everyone was like, “Oh, he’s a bum, he’s a bust,” and it was such a downward spiral. I remember going to church and posting a picture of the scripture I was reading, and people were commenting like, ‘You need to be praying for your hamstrings” and “You don’t need to be in church, you need to be on the field.'”</p><p>He continued, “Just weird stuff. So I remember being like, “I’m going to show the world who I am.” And the best part about my rookie year, not to say there was no expectations, but I was living freer. I was living out my dream. So it felt like everything was surreal.”</p><p>He also told the magazine at the time that he was “happier” than he’d ever been.”At this moment? I’m happier than I’ve ever been. I’ve never been at this place. And it’s because of the trials and tribulations, it’s because of the mistakes, it’s because of the failures, the successes. Everything that has got me to this point,” he said. He also confirmed that he was happier at that time than he had ever been in the NFL. “Just considering what I had been through. You have to think about a 21-year-old, 22-year-old, 23-year-old, 24-year-old kid. Honestly, the whole reason I play football is, one, for my momma,” he said. “Secondly, to inspire these kids. I was a kid playing in the Georgia Dome at halftime for 15 plays, and I was there to watch Mike Vick. To watch Allen Iverson. To watch these guys who inspire me to be who and where I’m at today. So it’s all for these kids.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/super-bowl-book.jpeg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$16.59+</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$29.95</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>45% Off</span></p><p>For more about the <a href=# id=auto-tag_super-bowl data-tag=super-bowl>Super Bowl</a>, football fans can check out <a data-pmc-sp-product=53d1db0529f18ff6311aa0fe97247319 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"When It Was Just a Game: Remembering the First Super Bowl","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"When It Was Just a Game: Remembering the First Super Bowl","price":"24.87","id":"1589799208","category":"State & Local"},"id":1252476,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>When It Was Just a Game: Remembering the First Super Bowl</a> by Harvey Frommer. The best-selling book delves into the history of the first Super Bowl, which was originally known as the AFL-NFL Championship Game. (The term “Super Bowl” was coined only in its third year.) The debut game, between the winning Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs, was played in front of only 61,946 people at&nbsp;the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum—an audience well&nbsp;below the stadium’s capacity. Harvey Frommer, a sports historian and reporter, puts the tale of that momentous game together using oral history, gathered by hundreds of interviews with players, coaches, media and spectators alike.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
