However, Soaps.com may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.</p><p>Jess Blake’s time on FBI was short-lived, as she was tragically killed off just two episodes after she was introduced. <a href=# rel=noopener>How did Jess Blake die on FBI</a>? Keep reading to find out.</p><p>FBI is CBS’ fictional crime drama that follows special agents at the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The elite team investigates the most dangerous criminal cases, including terrorism, organized crime and counterintelligence. Produced by Dick Wolf, the series premiered in 2018 and has spawned two spin-offs:&nbsp;FBI: Most Wanted&nbsp;and&nbsp;FBI: International. It stars Missy Peregrym as Special Agent Maggie Bell, Zeeko Zaki as Special Agent Omar Adom “OA” Zidan, John Boyd as Special Agent Stuart Scola, Katherine Renee Kane as Special Agent Tiffany Wallace, Jeremy Sisto as Assistant Special Agent in Charge Jubal Valentine and Alana de la Garza as Special Agent in Charge Isobel Castille.</p><p>Charlotte Sullivan came on board during the fourth episode of Season 6 as Special Agent Jessica “Jess” Blake. Jess is an old friend and former colleague of Maggie’s, as well as a single mother to her daughter Ella. The reunion was also an off-screen reunion, as Sullivan and Peregrym previously worked together on the Global/ABC police procedural&nbsp;Rookie Blue, which ran for six seasons from 2010 to 2015.</p><p>Jess’ time on the show was cut short, however, when she suddenly died during the sixth episode, marking the <a href=# rel=noopener>second death of the season</a>. Below, we have all the details on Jess Blake’s death, including how it will impact Maggie.</p><h2>How did Jess Blake die on FBI?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Charlotte-Sullivan.jpg alt="Charlotte Sullivan, Missy Peregrym FBI" width=1041 height=607 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>How did Jess Blake die on FBI? During the Season 6 episode “Unforeseen,” the team was hunting down an eco-terrorist who had killed multiple people using poisonous gas when Jess collapsed. She was then rushed to the hospital, where she learned that she had not been exposed to the gas and was actually suffering from a mild aneurysm. The doctor’s wanted to do exploratory surgery, but Jess needed to name an emergency contact and guardian for her daughter, Ella.</p><p>The special agent chose her old friend Maggie, who told agreed and told her: “Whatever you need.” Assuming the procedure would be minor and Jess would be fine, Maggie continued working the case. Toward the end of the episode, she returned to the hospital and waited with Ella until Jess came out of surgery. That never happened, though, as doctors informed Maggie that Jess did not make it. “We did everything we could,” the doctor said. “Her blood pressure dropped during the operation and we tried to resuscitate her but unfortunately it was too late.”</p><p>In the past few episodes, Maggie had been exploring the idea of motherhood and had multiple conversations about it with Jess and her boss Isobel. At one point, she revealed that she was looking into doing IVF. “I was thinking about IVF. I’m not sure that I’m going to do it. I want to. A big part of me wants to, but it’s a lot. I mean, just even getting pregnant, let alone the motherhood part,” she told Isobel, who said she supported whatever Maggie decided to do. She also confided in Jess that she wasn’t sure she was ready to become a mom, telling her: “I’m just not sure that I’m ready for the stress of it all—and the uncertainty.” Jess validated her hesitations, but noted, “I get it. You want control, but that’s just not how this works.”</p><p>With Jess’ death, Maggie might be stepping into parenthood a lot sooner than she expected. Although she’s only Ella’s temporary guardian and it’s still unclear if she will remain her guardian permanently, this could be the way Maggie was meant to become a mother. If she does decide to remain Ella’s guardian, it will certainly be interesting to see how Maggie balances her stressful job with caring for a child.</p><p>FBI airs on CBS on Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST and streams on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Paramount+</a>.</p><p>For more on FBI, check out this gallery on <a href=# rel=noopener>the cast’s children</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvYmiBcoKOo5ysq12br6p5w6KcaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjess-fbi-die.html&text=How%20Did%20Jess%20Blake%20Die%20on%20FBI%3f%20What%20Happened%20to%20Charlotte%20Sullivan%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjess-fbi-die.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjess-fbi-die.html&title=How%20Did%20Jess%20Blake%20Die%20on%20FBI%3f%20What%20Happened%20to%20Charlotte%20Sullivan%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjess-fbi-die.html&title=How%20Did%20Jess%20Blake%20Die%20on%20FBI%3f%20What%20Happened%20to%20Charlotte%20Sullivan%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjess-fbi-die.html&title=How%20Did%20Jess%20Blake%20Die%20on%20FBI%3f%20What%20Happened%20to%20Charlotte%20Sullivan%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjess-fbi-die.html&description=How%20Did%20Jess%20Blake%20Die%20on%20FBI%3f%20What%20Happened%20to%20Charlotte%20Sullivan%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./rachel-bilson-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rachel Bilson Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./grounded-level-2-axe-how-to-get-tier.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Grounded Level 2 Axe - How to Get Tier 2">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
