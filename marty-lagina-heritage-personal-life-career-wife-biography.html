after getting the title he started his own company and called it ‘Terra Energy Limited’.&nbsp;This company was primarily concerned with resource development for shale gas in Michigan.&nbsp;Marty and his company hoped to become the largest operators in the industry.&nbsp;However, in 1995, he turned his business over to CMS for $58 million, which was a good deal at the time.</span><p><span>His

businesses.</span></p><p><span>Marty then went out into the world with his brother Rick on the famous History Channel television series.&nbsp;Marty is playing a major role alongside Rick and the two brothers have been trying to solve the mysteries of Oak Island with the help of some experts and modern machinery.&nbsp;His main objective has been to discover the treasures and artifacts that are buried in the depths of the island.</span></p><p><span>Rick and Marty have been trying to learn more about the history of the place to unravel the mystery.&nbsp;Prometheus Entertainments started their
