<time>26 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Kelli Williams, a 47 years American actress is known for her appearance in an American legal drama The Practice. Her marriage life is very little known to the public eye, let's dig into her personal life.</p><p>Sometimes it takes decades to find fault in a person. Who you thought was your soulmate can easily turn out to be just another relationship in your life. This seems the case with <strong>Kelli Williams</strong>'s life, who recently separated from her longtime husband&nbsp;<strong>Ajay Sahgal</strong>.</p><p>Marriages between two celebrities often end in an instant. Although this couple took a relatively long period to part ways, they eventually did while spilling very little information. Let's find out what went wrong with this couple, that has been revealed so far.</p><h2>Kelli Williams's Marriage&nbsp;Life With Husband Ajay Sahgal</h2><p>Kelli Williams was happily married to writer and producer Ajay Sahgal in 1996. Williams and Sahgal were a happy couple as a loving wife and caring husband for more than two decades though there is very little information regarding their conjugal life. Despite being a celebrity, they stayed away from mainstream media and enjoyed quite a private married life. The couple rarely appeared in public, so fans rarely saw the pair together.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;according to IMDb, the couple <a href=# rel=noopener>ended their 21-year-long marriage in 2017</a>. It came as a total shock, cause they seemed perfectly fine before the news broke out. There is no information about the reason behind their divorce as the pair has not spoken regarding their split and no media reported about their separation. We can only assume that Williams and Sahgal decided on a different path as things didn't work out, and they chose not to talk about it in the media to avoid controversies.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/05/tumblrmkdf0htq3p1s9yb2zo1500.jpg alt="Kelli Williams and Ajay Sahgal" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Kelli Williams and Ajay Sahgal</strong></p><p><strong>Source: Networthroll</strong></p><p>Williams and Sahgal share 3 lovely children from their marriage, two sons, and a daughter; <strong>Kiran Ram Sahgal</strong> born in 1998, <strong>Sarame Jane Sahgal</strong> born in 2001, and <strong>Ravi Lyndon Sahgal</strong> born in 2003.&nbsp;They were an adorable family with cute children.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/05/kelli-and-ajay-family.jpg alt="Kelli and Ajay with their children" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Kelli and Ajay with their children, Kiran Ram Sahgal, Sarame Jane Sahgal, and Ravi Lyndon Sahgal.</strong></p><p>Though Williams separated from her husband, she is a doting mother to her children. She is very close to her children and hangs out with them from time to time. After her divorce, Kelli is enjoying her motherhood rather than looking for a boyfriend.</p><p>Ajay Sahgal, on the other hand, is not social media friendly and is seen very less in public. But then again, we can say he still is a loving father to his children as he was before.</p><p>Here is a picture of Williams's Instagram post with her happy family. They looked joyous while they were still together. But unfortunately, fate sometimes ends up having different plans. For better or worse, it remains to be seen.</p><h2>Kelli Williams's Career&nbsp;</h2><p>Kelli Williams is best known for her character of Lindsay Dole in an American legal drama The Practice&nbsp;(1997-2003), created by <strong>David E.
