At this point, there is still a ton of ground to cover between now and its release, but this article will give our best predictions based on statements by Marvel executives such as <strong><a href=#>Kevin Feige</a> </strong>and the comic runs for Secret Wars, as well as all the confirmed information hot from the press.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So without further ado, here's everything we know so far about Avengers: Secret Wars, the earths-shaking finale of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Multiverse Saga.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="How to Watch Marvel's Phase Four Movies and Shows in Order (Chronologically and by Release Date)">How to Watch Marvel's Phase Four Movies and Shows in Order (Chronologically and by Release Date)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-and-where-is-avengers-secret-wars-coming-out>When and Where Is Avengers: Secret Wars Coming Out?</h2><p>While the original release date of Avengers: Secret Wars shared at the San Diego Comic-Con 2022 was November 7, 2025, that release date has been pushed back significantly to May 1, 2026. There are several reasons for this change, and most of them aren’t really cause for concern. Part of this is to put a larger gap in the schedule between Avengers movies; With the original release date, there would have been less than a year's difference between <strong><a href=#>Avengers: The Kang Dynasty</a> </strong>and Avengers: Secret Wars. The new release date gives us nearly a full year's time separating the two Saga-ending films. While we may not always want to wait for more Avengers, it will probably be better for the production quality in the long run. For those wondering about how it will be released, there should be no surprise that it will be premiering exclusively in cinemas with an eventual release on <a href=#>Disney+</a>.</p><h2 id=who-39-s-in-the-cast-of-avengers-secret-wars>Who's In the Cast of Avengers: Secret Wars?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While we suspect that the vast majority of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's characters will have at least a cameo-level appearance in Avengers: Secret Wars, only some of them have been confirmed so far. These characters presumably are safe in their own upcoming movies, but everyone else may or may not make it to the end of Phase 6.</p><p>We know that <strong><a href=#>Jonathan Majors</a> </strong>will return as Kang the Conquerer alongside <strong><a href=#>Kathryn Newton</a> </strong>as Cassie Lang. We don't have any confirmation on whether any of the other characters who will appear in<strong> <a href=#>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</a> </strong>will make it to the end, but as Kang is the main villain in that film, it will likely have a large impact on Avengers: Secret Wars. Alongside the Ant-Man-related characters, we also have many of the big hitters expected to return, including <strong><a href=#>Mark Ruffalo</a> </strong>as Bruce Banner, <strong><a href=#>Chris Hemsworth</a> </strong>as Thor, <strong><a href=#>Anthony Mackie</a> </strong>as Captain America, and <strong><a href=#>Benedict Cumberbatch</a> </strong>as Doctor Strange. Those are definitely some of the names we've gotten used to seeing on Avengers cast lists, but others that we haven't seen as much are also expected to appear. Those others include <strong><a href=#>Simi Liu</a> </strong>as Shang-Chi, <strong><a href=#>Iman Vellani</a> </strong>as Ms. Marvel, <strong><a href=#>Xochitl Gomez</a> </strong>as America Chavez, <strong><a href=#>Dominique Thorne</a> </strong>as Riri Williams (aka Ironheart), and <strong><a href=#>Benedict Wong</a> </strong>as Wong. Those are all the actors reported to be in the movie so far, but that number is likely to grow exponentially, especially given that the 2015 comic book story that we suspect this next movie is based on has many Fantastic Four characters at center stage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-should-the-fans-look-out-for>Who Should the Fans Look Out For?</h2><p>The major characters that have not yet been introduced into the Marvel Cinematic Universe that are most likely to impact Avengers: Secret Wars are <a href=#>Doctor Doom</a> and Molecule Man. Most people know about Doctor Doom and there is a clear path to introducing him in the upcoming <strong><a href=#>Fantastic Four</a> </strong>movie set to come out in 2025, but Molecule Man is lesser known. He has many abilities thanks to his contact with the Beyonders, but his most important ability is that he is a constant throughout the Multiverse. Oh, and he has godlike powers over reality on a quantum level. If either of these characters appears in the upcoming Marvel films the fans should take special notice as they likely hold the key to Avengers: Secret Wars.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title='Benedict Wong is Enjoying Being a Part of the "Wong Cinematic Universe"'>Benedict Wong is Enjoying Being a Part of the "Wong Cinematic Universe"</a></span></p><h2 id=who-39-s-making-avengers-secret-wars>Who's Making Avengers: Secret Wars?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In terms of the director or writing credits, there is only one person officially on the project so far and that's <a href=#><strong>Michael Waldron</strong></a>, who's penning the script.<strong> </strong>Waldron has been a producer for several shows such as <strong><a href=#>Loki</a> </strong>(which he created) and <strong>Rick and Morty </strong>as well as the writer for Loki and <a href=#><strong>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</strong></a>. So far, he has done excellent work in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and we should have high hopes for his work on Secret Wars as well. Kevin Feige will of course be the producer for the film and casting for the movie is being handled by Marvel vet <strong>Sarah Finn</strong>.</p><h2 id=what-do-we-know-about-the-avengers-secret-wars-plot>What Do We Know About the Avengers: Secret Wars Plot?</h2><p>We know that the Marvel Cinematic Universe almost always pulls from the comic runs, and there are two of those to pull from for the film. The first is <a href=#>the original Secret Wars</a>, which saw villains and heroes pulled into a patchwork planet called Battleworld by a mysterious being known as the Beyonder. It first ran in 1984. The second run was released in 2015 and focuses on the destruction of the Marvel Multiverse. Other storylines that could intersect with the film's story are the House of M storyline and the Age of Apocalypse storylines. While the Marvel Cinematic Universe has not exactly followed either of those previous comic runs by any means there are certainly a number of options open for the creators to explore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is more likely that the movie will follow the <a href=#>2015 Secret Wars storyline</a>. In the lead-up to the event, the Beyonders (the main villains of sorts) fight a multiverse-level war that destroys Earths through a series of <a href=#>Incursions</a>. Doctor Doom, the secret other party who opposes the Beyonders, then foils this plan but twists things to gain unlimited power, creating a new Battleworld from the broken pieces of the multiverse and installing himself as God Emperor.</p><p>So far we have seen a good amount of evidence that the idea of Incursions is in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, most notably in Multiverse of Madness. We saw that on <a href=#>Earth-838</a>, incursions are events that can destroy multiple universes. We've also seen a lot of multiverse-jumping in <a href=#><strong>Spider-Man: No Way Home</strong></a>, with the promise of plenty more to come.<strong> </strong>All of this could very well be the prelude to a planet-threatening Incursion event. And if that isn't an Avengers-level threat, what is?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51krrexzaCcq6tdqLKkvsStZLCZoqh6s7HLnpisnV2ZrrWxjJyYrKxdpbmwwIymmKuulaF8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2favengers-secret-wars-release-date-cast-plot-marvel.html&text=Release%20Date%2c%20Cast%2c%20Plot%2c%20and%20Everything%20We%20Know&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2favengers-secret-wars-release-date-cast-plot-marvel.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2favengers-secret-wars-release-date-cast-plot-marvel.html&title=Release%20Date%2c%20Cast%2c%20Plot%2c%20and%20Everything%20We%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2favengers-secret-wars-release-date-cast-plot-marvel.html&title=Release%20Date%2c%20Cast%2c%20Plot%2c%20and%20Everything%20We%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2favengers-secret-wars-release-date-cast-plot-marvel.html&title=Release%20Date%2c%20Cast%2c%20Plot%2c%20and%20Everything%20We%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2favengers-secret-wars-release-date-cast-plot-marvel.html&description=Release%20Date%2c%20Cast%2c%20Plot%2c%20and%20Everything%20We%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./travon-shaw-sentenced-for-killing-keona-holley-in-baltimore.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shooter Gets Life In Prison For Murdering Baltimore Police Officer: State's Attorney">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./priest-bites-woman-in-the-arm-during-communion-clash-at-florida-church-st-thomas-aquinas-church-incident-st-cloud-father-fidel-rodriguez-st-cloud-police-mass-body-of-christ-communion-line-sunday-may-19-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Priest bites woman during Communion clash at Florida church">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
