Learn about his family, height, age, and job in this article below.</p><p>This piece covers all the information you’ve been looking to learn about SK Alagbada.</p><h3><strong>Love Is Blind 3: Are SK Alagbada And Raven Ross Still Together?</strong></h3><p>Raven Ross and SK Alagbada hit it off immediately right after their first meeting in the pods. He admits that he is from a close-knit Nigerian family and seemed to admire Raven’s sense of independence. He reveals that being from a polygamist household has given him a broader perspective on relationships.</p><p>Although he is not a fan of polygamy, he wants a partnership sans traditional gender roles. When SK revealed this private information to Raven and received her cold ‘NBD’ answer, SK appeared to fall a little deeper.</p><p>As a dedicated Pilates instructor, Raven actually clicked with Robert “Bartise” Bowden at first, despite the fact that they were both sincere in their communication. That’s because the former was interested in SK even though she had initially dismissed him as “a square,” and Bartise found himself emotionally drawn to Nancy Rodriguez.</p><p>However, over time, the then 27-year-perception old’s of the Nigerian who was 7 years older than her was completely altered by straightforward yet profound dialogues, a feeling of comfort and understanding, and genuine intents.</p><p>“Every day, I feel closer and closer to you. I’ve always sought something really intentional in a woman, and I have to say I haven’t found that in any other woman but you,” SK tells her.</p><p>At this point, Raven appears to have made the decision to only concentrate on SK, which prompted further discussions about their shared needs and preferences for love as well as their aspirations for the future and lives. She did admit that she was feeling deep and that this was new territory for her, but he made it crystal obvious right away that he isn’t even “attracted to basic, straightforward” and wants her to find love in her own special manner.</p><p>Therefore, it was only natural that when SK got down on one knee and asked her what was possibly the most significant question of all, she responded with a joyful, “Yes, sir! Yes, I will! It’s a hard yes for me.” Adding later, “I’m ready for Club SK.”</p><p>For the time being, Netflix has only made available the first four episodes of the series, so it’s unclear exactly what occurs between these two. And my post-production investigation’s findings are still ambiguous. Although Raven and SK do not follow one another on social media. Though most of Raven’s photos are liked by SK.</p><h3><strong>SK Alagbada Age</strong></h3><p>At the time of the premiere of the show, SK Alagbada was 34 years old.</p><h3><strong>SK Alagbada Family</strong></h3><p>Sikiru “SK” Alagbada was raised in a close tight-knit family. However, he hasn’t shared much about his father on his socials.</p><p>On 29 September 2022, SK wished his mother Adeola a birthday. He wrote, “It takes a special kind of woman to care for me and sacrifice everything to make sure we’re good. In times of wins and celebrations, you are my biggest cheerleader. In times of despair and tribulations, you are my solace. Your heart of gold and unconditional love is irreplaceable, and I am proud to be your son.<br>Happy birthday Adeola, Love you, Mom!”</p><p>In his family, SK has at least one younger brother known as AB (<a href=#>@dadreamchaser2.0</a>), an attendee of Indiana University. On 16 October, he wished his brother, “Happy birthday Lil bro! I’m extremely proud of the man you’ve become. More Life.” His second brother graduated with a Master’s Degree from Texas State University in 2018.</p><p>He is also related to Shantell Alagbada who is currently a resident of Houston, Texas.</p><h3><strong>Is SK Alagbada On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Yes, SK Alagbada is on Instagram (<a href=#>@sk4ever2</a>).</p><h3><strong>SK Alagbada Height</strong></h3><p>Per his photographs, SK Alagbada stands tall at the height of 5 feet 10 inches.</p><h3><strong>SK Alagbada Job</strong></h3><p>Per the LinkedIn of SK Alagbada, he is currently a co-chair at LAUNCH: The University of California’s Startup Accelerator. He took the role in January 2022. UC LAUNCH is the University of California’s leading accelerator program that guides startups from prototype to pitch. Since 1999, our program has helped transform early-stage startups into fundable companies.</p><p>Over the past five years, the university’s alumni have raised over $125 million, topped the Forbes 30 under 30, and 9 startups have gone on to Y Combinator.</p><p>In addition, SK is also working as Senior Data Engineer at JPMorgan Chase & Co. He previously served as Senior Data Engineer at General Motors for almost five years. The earliest jobs he had in his life were working as IT Consultant at CGI and Egencia, an Expedia company.</p><p>SK holds a BS degree from Baylor University and MBA from <span class="mr1 hoverable-link-text t-bold"><span aria-hidden=true>University of California, Berkeley, Haas School of Business.
