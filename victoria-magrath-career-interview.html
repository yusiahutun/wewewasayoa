Not only because the term 'influencer' can cause contention, but because not all of what I do can be defined neatly into one single sentence. I am a brand ambassador, content creator, fashion and beauty blogger, brand consultant, author, influencer and entrepreneur. I am also the director of a social media marketing company, with a team to consider and inspire. For too long, I feel that influencers have struggled under the weight of their critics, but I endeavour to be proud of what I have created over the last 10 years. Our channels are a bridge between brands and their customer base; carefully curated, direct-to-consumer marketing paired with increased engagement allows the consumer a voice."</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>What was your first job?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"My first job was as a waitress in a local restaurant close to my home in the north of England. I was keen to be independent, so saving for driving lessons (and my very first pair of Dr. Martens) was at the top of my wish list. I absolutely loved working with people and still do! It taught me the importance of kindness and consistency. Nothing in life comes easy but hard work, persistence and consistency make your goals ever the more in reach."</p><img alt="victoria magrath" title="Victoria Magrath In the Frow" width=1800 height=1200 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/victoria-magrath-in-the-frow-1646907014.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span></p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Was there ever a time when you thought about giving up, or changing career paths?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Over the last 10 years, there have been times where I have contemplated stepping away from social media. Living the various ups and downs of life on a social platform has its challenges, especially as a woman. My community and their unwavering support have kept me going. We share the same passions, goals and aspirations and connecting with them has been one of the many joys of my life. They and the many incredible sides to social media, continue to overshadow any negativity, feelings of overwhelm, or exhaustion. I get a huge sense of satisfaction when my audience find products they love through my recommendations, I feel as if I have played a small part in making them feel wonderful - and if that isn’t a reason to stick at a job, I don’t know what is."</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>What was the job or career moment that changed your life, and why?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"There have been many memorable career highlights that have played a part in shaping my life; releasing my book, becoming a brand ambassador for <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cledepeau-beaute.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clé De Peau" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Clé De Peau</a> and being named the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vuelio.com/uk/social-media-index/top-20-uk-fashion-blogs/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="UK’s Top Fashion Blog" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">UK’s Top Fashion Blog</a> for five consecutive years are just a few.

I had been approached by a talent management agency in London who had seen that my community online was starting to grow and decided to bite the bullet. There were many sleepless nights between myself, Alex (my now-husband), and Rebecca (my first official employee), penning blog posts, nurturing my community, and building relationships within the industry - but it was worth it. Alex and I packed up our things, moved to London and with a lot of cheerleading from my loved ones, my hobby steadily became my career. Looking back it was a brave step to take as the industry was in its infancy, but you only regret the chance you didn’t take and I am so glad I took the leap."</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for How to build a career in fashion with Victoria from Inthefrow" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2019-04-04-at-14-23-25-1554384219.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Did you ever have a moment where you thought, ‘I’m successful now’, and if so, what was it?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Would you believe me if I said I still haven’t had that moment? The words of an acceptance speech by Mathew McConaughey (no less) continue to ring in my ears. He said; 'There are three things I need each day. One, I need something to look up to, another is something to look forward to, and another is someone to chase.' He suggested that the 'someone to chase' should be the version of yourself that you aspire to be in 10 years’ time. I consistently move my own goal posts and it is this that has kept me striving for that little bit more, so much so that I am not sure that 'moment' will ever exist for me."</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>What have you learnt about the concept of success? What does success mean to you?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Success to me means being able to share my life with those I love. Whether that means being able to take care of my parents, spoil my friends or invest in those that have encouraged and supported me along the way. If I can repay and invest in those who invested their time and confidence in me, then I’ll consider myself on the way to being successful."</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Who do you credit for helping get you where you are today? And did you ever have a mentor?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I am and have been incredibly fortunate to be surrounded by a flurry of the most intelligent, talented, and inspirational women throughout my life. From my PhD mentor, Dr Helen McCormick; to my communications director Briony (one of Business Insider’s Top Talent Managers of 2020); to my ever supportive mum; to my friend and mentor, Vita Liberata founder Alyson Hogg MBE. I could list a hundred reasons as to why these women (and many more) have influenced my career. Hard work is integral to any form of success but having a community of spectacular, confident women to cheer you on and raise you up? Invaluable."</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>If you weren’t doing this, what would your alternative dream job be?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"A lecturer in Fashion Marketing, specialising in e-commerce and consumer behaviour. As a university student of Fashion Marketing my dream was to work in PR for a luxury retailer such as Net-a-Porter or Flannels. After a couple of internships and work placements in the space, I gained a newfound love for the marketing involved in e-commerce. That in turn led me to a PhD focused on Fashion Consumer Behaviour and the emerging impact of Mobile Commerce, and from there I was offered a role as a Fashion Marketing lecturer.

I overcome doubt by maintaining a supportive team around me: my friends, family and the people I work with. Social media can be brutal and learning to protect myself from the negativity of others has been key. We have many sanctions in place to ensure that my community can engage and exist within in a positive, safe space as much as possible."</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Have you ever had a moment where you’ve felt like a failure?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Absolutely! But I try to remind myself that feeling like a failure does not necessarily mean that I have failed. With age and experience, I have come to accept that there is no direct path to success. There will be unexpected twists and turns at every corner; what matters is how you approach that next phase. Times when I have felt the presence of failure lurking over my shoulder have actually been the most formative moments of my life. Whether a lesson has been learnt, a situation has been avoided or an opportunity has arisen, each moment is a time that I can look back on with perspective and humility."</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=36 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>How do you decide which brands to work with, and how do you know which offers you should decline?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Over the years I have become more and more selective over the brands I choose to work with. If I would not use the product myself nor recommend it to my family, friends or community then I will not promote it on my channels. I do more research than ever when working with brands, so I can be sure that their ethics align with my own. I have been incredibly lucky to work with brands that I admire on an ambassador level.

I don’t know of anyone in the industry that hasn’t been affected in some way by someone else’s negativity. A thick skin shouldn’t be a necessity for a career online but it certainly helps. I try to maintain the perspective that no individual online can fulfil the expectations that another has unknowingly placed on them.

I find sharing my doubt to be a huge antidote; it helps me to realise that I am not alone, and many share my experiences. I think in a world that has the potential to cause so much harm, we have a duty to be kind to others but most importantly to be kind to ourselves."</p><h2 data-node-id=49 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>What motivates you?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The future is my main motivator.
