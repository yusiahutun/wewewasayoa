These include married couple Harper (Aubrey Plaza) and Ethan (Will Sharpe), who have been invited for a getaway by Ethan's former college roommate, Cameron (Theo James), and his wife, Daphne (Meghann Fahy). Ethan and Harper are newly rich, with Ethan having recently sold his startup company, while their traveling companions have long been "atrophied" by their gargantuan wealth. Meanwhile, generational divides are apparent in the Di Grasso family, in which patriarch Bert (F. Murray Abraham), his Hollywood executive son Dominic (Michael Imperioli), and Dominic's son Albie (Adam DiMarco) awkwardly navigate the elephant in the first-class suite that is Dom's serial cheating on Albie's mother. Lastly, the tender-hearted, harebrained heiress Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge) is a familiar face amongst the Sicilian arrivals. This time around, she's newly married to her beau from last season, Greg (Jon Gries), and has dragged her 20-something, discontented assistant, Portia (Haley Lu Richardson), along for the ride.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Like the previous season, Episode 1 (titled "Ciao") sets the stage for a murder mystery to unfold. It opens with the delightfully fizzy Daphne, who strikes up a conversation with new arrivals to reminisce on her weeklong vacation. "Italy's just so romantic," she says. "You're gonna die. They're gonna have to drag you out of here." On that optimistic note, Daphne leaves them to take one last dip in the glistening Ionian Sea. All is well until she feels something touch her underwater—then the floating body comes into focus. Apparently, there are multiple bodies to be retrieved from the sea, according to a hotel staffer's report. But, the identities of the killed and the killer(s?) won't be given to us so easily, and the show takes us back seven days prior, to our ensemble's arrivals.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Greeting the guests is Valentina (Sabrina Impacciatore), this season's high-strung, perfectionist hotel manager, who routinely cracks the whip on her band of complacent hirelings. And lurking in the background watching the guests step off their ivory yachts are Lucia (Simona Tabasco), a sex worker hired by one of the arrivals, and her best friend Mia (Beatrice Grannò).</p><img alt="white lotus" title="white lotus" width=640 height=427 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sabrina-impacciatore-1666993487.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Fabio Lovino/HBO</span><p>Valentina and hotel staff wave as guests arrive at The White Lotus in Sicily.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As the new guests settle into their rooms, they're also introduced to the seeming omnipresence of colorfully painted ceramic head statues, tastefully situated all around the resort. They're based on testa di moro, a legend about a Sicilian girl who was seduced by a Moorish man. Upon discovering that her lover already had a wife and children, she cut off his head. "It’s a warning to husbands, babe," Daphne jokes. "Screw around and you’ll end up buried in the garden."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's clear that there is no chemistry between the co-vacationing couples. Harper is initially cold and standoffish, refusing even to pick up a champagne flute to collectively toast to their impending holiday together. But we can very quickly glean that she's threatened by Daphne and Cameron—by their profuse PDA, their disregard for world affairs and voting, their shameless cocooning in their income bracket. She fears how her and Ethan's newfound riches might transform them to behave similarly.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Suspicion of their companions only increase when Harper and Cameron venture into her suite alone so that Cameron, who lost his luggage en route to Sicily, may borrow a pair of Ethan's swimming trunks. As Harper rummages through her bag of toiletries in the bathroom, Cameron undresses right behind her—his bare butt in full view and reflecting off the giant, obvious mirror Harper is standing right in front of. She's baffled—and, now, indignant. (Meanwhile, Cameron is the evident frontrunner for this season's resident entitled douchebag; though, unlike <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a37246748/jake-lacy-the-white-lotus-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Shane from last season" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Shane from last season</a>, he commands an altogether more cunning and calculated presence.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The foursome aren't the only ones facing marriage woes. Tanya arriving to the White Lotus with a crap ton of baggage (interpret that how you see fit) and Portia only enrages Greg, who demands that she send her assistant home from their romantic vacation immediately. Tanya obeys—kind of. More specifically, she tells her jaded attendant to "lay low and not come out of your room." You know, in case Tanya ends up needing her emotional support later on in the trip.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This sends Portia into hysterics. She retreats to one of the sun-beds that border the resort's pool, crying into her phone as she confides in a friend. "She's a miserable mess," she says. "If I had a half-billion dollars, I would not be miserable. I would be enjoying my life."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Poolside, Portia meets Albie, who has briefly escaped the company of his bumbling, uncontrollably farting grandfather and cheater dad. As they chat, Bert makes his way down the staircase leading to the pool and accidentally falls into the ground. Albie runs to his rescue, worrying that his 80-year-old grandfather could be suffering from a concussion, but the felled Bert is now only preoccupied by Portia's presence. "Who's the girl?" he asks his grandson.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's this hyper-masculine treatment of women that pits Di Grasso against Di Grasso against Di Grasso on their multi-generational trip. Both Albie and Dom view Bert as a senior pervert, with his unending attempts to flirt with any breathing woman within six inches of him. Though, Dom's streak of infidelity doesn't win him any points either. "No girl should have to be exposed to an old guy's junk," Albie tells them both over dinner. Bert retorts, "It's not like it was ever so beautiful to look at anyway. I mean, it's a penis, not a sunset."</p><img alt="white lotus" title="white lotus" width=1920 height=1280 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/michael-imperioli-adam-dimarco-f-murray-abraham-1666994957.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Fabio Lovino/HBO</span><p>Bert, Dominic, and Albie arrive at the resort.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lucia and Mia attempt entry into the hotel, but are swiftly confronted and escorted out by Valentina. There's a subsequent, deliciously delivered exchange between Lucia and Valentina, the latter of whom disparages Lucia's occupation. "At least, I don’t have sex for money," Valentina says. Provoked, Lucia throws back, "Who’d pay to have sex with you? Uptight, ugly bitch!" Brava!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Forced to skulk outside the hotel until they can sneak their way in, Lucia tries to convince her friend to have a threesome with her and her still-unknown client so that they can make double the money. Mia seems intrigued by Lucia's life, but ultimately declines the offer, citing a recent heartbreak as her inability to participate.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When the duo are finally able to evade Valentina's watch and enter the resort, they set up base at the hotel restaurant's bar, where Mia becomes entranced by a singing piano player. As the night goes on, Lucia leaves the bar to fulfill her appointment, giving Mia the opportunity to approach the singer, Giuseppe. She reveals to him that she, too, is a musician, aspiring to have a job that allows her to perform in the way he does. Giuseppe only seems to half-register what she's telling him before he asks her how much she'll cost for the night. It's a shocking question for Mia, who leaves immediately—but not before throwing her drink in his face.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Meanwhile, Lucia materializes before her client's door. She knocks and—lo and behold—Dom answers. Is anyone surprised? The two drink, engage in idle chit-chat. Dom is kind of a bummer (after all, he did just call his ex-wife in an outrageously failed bid to win her back hours prior) and doesn't give Lucia much to work with, conversation-wise. Finally, he ends her misery. "It's hard for me to make conversation right now, but you are very beautiful," he says. "I'm glad you're here." Words aren't needed for the rest of the night.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
