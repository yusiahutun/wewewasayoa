Most men have resorted to putting fancy hair styles in order to boost their sex appeal for various reasons, official or casual. Nowadays, haircuts are not only associated with only black men like a while back. Most white people are beginning to embrace the art of haircuts and have even taken the initiative of learning and becoming good at shaving different styles. The most common hair style that has a craze all over the world is the fade haircut. People keep asking whatâ€™s the best fade haircut?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs5i8d9auftlo.jpg><p class=align-left>The answers are here. There are different types of fade haircuts that are in existence, some of them are mentioned below:</p><h2>Best fade haircut styles for men</h2><h3><strong>1. Drop fade haircut black men</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs1ju92fsemafo.jpg><p class=align-left>This hair style is more or less the same in comparison to the regular fade haircut. However, there is a bit of a difference since it gradually lowers at the back of the head and the area of the front of the hair line. It offers a sharper look on the front and provides a stronger outline to the face, at the same time also allowing more depth around the crown of the head. There is a sense of a symmetric pattern in the fades and how they are put on the sides to bring a contrast with the top. The top usually has more hair, around middle or longer looking hair so that there is a better blend. However, it is mostly better looking on longer hair. It can also be well merged with other styles such as the undercut or the pompadour hair style. This is definitely a style that is common amongst young people and can bring out a fresh look even with official outfit.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a1071b05ea4445cc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>11 best Edgar haircuts for men in 2020</span></p></a><h3><strong>2. Low fade haircut</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a1071b05ea4445cc.jpg><p class=align-left>This type of haircut is the opposite of the high fade as the taper and fade begin lower on the head. The fade actually begins below the taper, which begins almost just above the ear and neck line. This style brings out less contrast on the hair but is still trendy. It offers more texture towards the sides of the head. It is a good hair style for those who are into medium or longer length of hair which may require some level of thickness. This may also be blended in quite well with the beards as the fade can drop down to the beards to finish a sharp look. Low fade haircut black men works best for traditional hair styles and surprisingly enough, for office settings. This style can also be topped up with some cuts that may enhance the look so as not to look boring.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1a31a58f44080ce9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bowl cut girl ideas - 20+ pictures</span></p></a><h3><strong>3.

It features a tapering process near the top of the head but still does not lose its touch of fade. This mix of fade and taper brings forth a good contrast between the long and shorter hair. It produces a stronger look when it is started from the top in a progressive manner in a way where the number 4 blends with number two until the fade touches the skin. This hair style brings forth a better look on young people and makes them look fancy, whether black or white. If you want to have this great look, you should probably get the nearest barbershop to you and have a fiery look that will send her ogling.

Bald fade haircut</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs64b0uaib3k4.jpg><p class=align-left>This hair style features a fade that is put on the sides but does not drop to the bottom. Instead, the fade begins touching the skin after where the hair ends, which actually pushes the fade to its limit. It is also referred to as the skin fade haircut or the zero fade haircut. This style is unique as not everybody goes for it; it always simple yet complicated. It requires a trim right down to the skin of the head and in most cases, the barber will either use no guard, an outliner or a specialty shaver. This look is the best for official occasions, but if you still want to rock it to an informal occasion, you can walk down to your barber today and put this style on your head.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Best hairstyles for men in Kenya 2018</p><h3><strong>5.

With icons such as Miguel and some other black stars, this look has started creeping up into the black culture. This hair style can feature either of the sides of the head faded or both sides but the top has long hair which is mostly relaxed towards one side. This style can have a combination of the undercut on one side which is disconnected with a cut on the upper side of the head to form the falling fade on one side and a progressive fade on the other side of the head that is slightly similar to the mid fade haircut.

It increases the sex appeal and can land you a date if you have the right barber for this job. Always remember that the barber is the strongest man in the world as he can either get you roasted or laid for the next two weeks.

Temp fade</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3f5d990ec45318c8.jpg><p class=align-left>This is one of the best looking hair styles for fade, yet requires a lot of skill. This style requires a blade to make the ends of the hair to look like it is fading towards the face. This style of fade begins from the middle of the head and the fade falls down to the sides of the head and forms a diminishing symmetry that makes you look rather young than your actual age. The top of the head is either untouched or just slightly shaped to be even throughout. The fade ends with the skin being bare near the ears and mostly blends in with those with no side bans. However, this style can also be put by those with side bans as the fade will be prolonged to give a sharper look with the ends. This is definitely a fresh look for the young men and if you have curly thick hair and you are an African male with either soft or tough hair, then this style is yours, as long as you can maintain it.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs554n5k8coec.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best black men hairstyles</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Fade haircut styles for kids</p><p class=align-left>You can get these and more fade haircut pictures on the internet.
