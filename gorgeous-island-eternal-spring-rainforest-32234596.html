<time>14 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>"Close your eyes and allow yourself to be present in the moment.”</p><p>It’s not every day you encounter a professional violinist in an ancient wooded hill on an island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, but this is <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>Madeira</a> and they like to do things a little differently here. She then performed a private concert for us while we sat among the leaves, letting the ethereal music wash over us.</p><p>The experience was just one of many we indulged in after checking into Madeira’s Yeotown health retreat. Dubbed “the island home of complete wellbeing”, it is the sister resort of the North Devon Wellness Retreat set up 13 years ago, offering treatments to improve health and wellbeing for the mind and body.</p><p><b><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>READ MORE: Sun-drenched beach hotspot with 33C weather in March has rainforest and £17 rooms</a></b></p><p><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news><b>READ MORE: TUI, EasyJet, Ryanair, Jet2 and British Airways rules for bringing food on a flight</b></a></p><p>We had started the day with a spot of gentle yoga in a herbal-oil scented room, with open doors letting the ocean breeze flow in. The staff at the retreat meticulously plan every detail of their guests’ days so they are surrounded by a beautifully stimulating environment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32234661.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Compassion-032.jpg><p>Think martinis made from freshly picked fruits grown on site and served in brightly coloured Chinese-styled mugs, to stunning flowers draped along a wooden alfresco dining table. Everything consumed here is prepared by the retreat’s award-winning chef so, for lunch, we feasted on crisp and spicy cauliflower wings, coconut rice and peanut sauce broccoli.</p><p>I spent the afternoon having a full-body Thai massage from the in-house masseur, stretching out any tensions. As the sun set, we were enticed by the smells of roasting fish before dining at a rustic outside table while our personal chef served us a barbecue. It was a first day well spent. For me, the whole point of a holiday is to feel relaxed and refreshed – and to achieve this so soon was certainly a win.</p><p>Nicknamed “island of eternal spring”, Madeira is a tonic in itself. It’s a Portuguese outpost but is closer to Africa than Europe. Its northern side felt like remote parts of Vietnam, with an abundance of tropical foliage, banana trees and dramatic cliffs.</p><p>It boasts some of the most fertile soil in the world due to being a volcanic island, and this is evident in its rainbow of wild and exotic flowers, lush forests and terraces of sugar canes and laurel trees.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32234673.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Compassion-023.jpg><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=32230170><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index1|Image aria-label="European city begs 'nuisance' Brits to stay away – so more than ever are visiting" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=32230170><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32230284.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_Red-Light-District-In-Amsterdam.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32230284.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Red-Light-District-In-Amsterdam.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index1|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=32230170>European city begs 'nuisance' Brits to stay away – so more than ever are visiting</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p>The following day we explored the island’s rugged north on an off-roading Jeep tour. As our driver, Pedro, manoeuvred the vehicle through slippery mud tracks that were cut off from the world to everyone but mountain bikers or 4x4 drivers, he pointed to the island’s breathtaking volcanic scenery, proudly telling us “it’s 50 shades of green”.</p><p>He knew the island inside out and during our half-day tour showed us everything from a traditional thatched-roof Santana house to the island’s last mill, where residents aged 80-plus still grind wheat. He also knew the most picturesque view points, where we could catch our breath from the pulse-raising ride while taking in the scenery.</p><p>“You experience four seasons in one day and five continents in one island,” Pedro said. And he wasn’t wrong; the mist clinging to the island’s cliffs cleared by lunchtime, and we basked in bright sunshine all afternoon.</p><p>Despite being October, temperatures were still in the high 20s. It rarely dips below 19C, due to the island’s microclimate, making it the perfect place for a spot of winter sun.</p><p>While Madeira’s south coast is bustling with grand hotels and Airbnbs, the sparsely populated north is still relatively undiscovered by tourists. You could walk all day along the island’s famous levada trails without seeing another soul.</p><span class=disclaimer-text>This article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.</span> <a href=#>Learn more</a> Best cabin bags and accessories for travel <a class=affiliate-title href=# rel=nofollow>Eono 3/4/6 Set Compression Packing Cubes</a> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32197188.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_61Ft6h82PFL_AC_SX569_.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>By closing the strong, full-coverage outer zipper, Eono packing cubes achieve a significant compression effect, which saves a lot of space in your suitcase.

This was rounded off with a glass of Madeira’s famous Poncha – a summer cocktail made from sugar cane, orange or lemon juice, honey and rum. That night we slept in the newly-launched upscale villas of the Terrabona Nature & Vineyards.</p><p>The lush surroundings of the Laurissilva forest, a UNESCO world natural heritage site, gave a supremely restful feel. Each villa is cleverly positioned so there is no intrusion from other guests, allowing a sense of solitude. At night, the only other light comes from the stars, and the only sound comes from the surrounding wildlife.</p><p>Breakfast is left inside your fridge, with fresh bread delivered outside your door every morning. Terrabona’s owners, a family whose dream was to open up the north to tourists, have thought of everything, including a pillow menu and the option to pick fresh tea leaves from outside your villa. The retreat also has a sleek infinity pool positioned in the cliff face among the resort’s vineyards.</p><p>The island’s handsome capital of Funchal is definitely worth a visit to see its paved squares, historic churches and botanical gardens. Set in a natural amphitheatre by the sea, squeezed between cliffs and soaring mountains, it’s also great for a drink, a meal and a stroll. In the evening live jazz drifts out of music venues, fairy lights illuminate the lanes and there’s a laid-back buzz about the place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>Tucked away down one of Funchal’s many beautiful lanes is Akua, where award-winning chef Julio Pereira specialises in serving up Madeira’s local produce with creative flair. Almost everything is either grown on the island or caught in the waters that surround it.</p><p>For my starter, I had soft beetroot, drizzled with a tangy sauce, followed by pumpkin flaked with coconut and nuts. They also serve fabulous seafood with rare treats such as tuna sausages.</p><p>Islanders are very proud of their home-grown superstar footballer, Cristiano Ronaldo. A statue of the former Manchester United player welcomes guests at the airport. He even has his own hotel in the capital, Pestana CR7, which has a fabulous pink-coloured rooftop pool.</p><p>Locals say everyone knows everyone else in Madeira, which means you can’t go far without meeting someone with a story to share about Ronaldo, despite the star leaving for the mainland at the age of 11.</p><p>We also stayed at Castanheiro Boutique Hotel, which has a sunroof infinity pool overlooking the bay and plenty of loungers – perfect for people who want to sleep or relax in the sunshine.</p><p>There is also a spa with a powerful steam room and turquoise bathwaters that moisturise your skin as you swim. Whatever your reason to visit, be it relaxing, recharging or ­reconnecting with nature, magnificent Madeira is an island to savour.</p><h2>Book the holiday</h2><ul><li>Flights to Funchal, Madeira, are available with British Airways, TAP, easyJet, Ryanair, TUI and Jet2 from airports including Belfast International, Birmingham, Bristol, East Midlands, Edinburgh, Gatwick, Glasgow, Heathrow, Leeds Bradford, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Stansted.</li><li>A three night B&B stay (minimum) in a villa at Terrabona Nature & Vineyards near Boaventura, Madeira, starts at around £811. <a href=# rel=nofollow>en.terrabonawine.com</a></li><li>Rooms at the Castanheiro Boutique Hotel in Funchal start at around £103 a night B&B. <a href=# rel=nofollow>castanheiroboutiquehotel.com</a></li><li>More info at <a href=# rel=nofollow>visitmadeira.com</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKyilsOmuI6tqZqulaF6r7HWrGagp6KcsrDB0magrKSRo7FusdOeqaeZnGLAsb7Ip55mqpGeu6e70Z6qrWVjZ390gJRybQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgorgeous-island-eternal-spring-rainforest-32234596.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgorgeous-island-eternal-spring-rainforest-32234596.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgorgeous-island-eternal-spring-rainforest-32234596.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgorgeous-island-eternal-spring-rainforest-32234596.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgorgeous-island-eternal-spring-rainforest-32234596.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgorgeous-island-eternal-spring-rainforest-32234596.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./taylor-swift-is-it-over-now-sad-boat-photo-harry-styles.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./taylor-swift-is-it-over-now-sad-boat-photo-harry-styles.html>Taylor Swifts Song Is It Over Now?
