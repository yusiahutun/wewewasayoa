<time>27 Jan 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><h2>Justin Timberlake responds to Britney Spears’ Woman in Me</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-76235991.jpg><p>Justin Timberlake hasn’t issued an official response to Britney Spears’ Woman in Me book but sources said that he’s keeping his distance. “Justin will always be supportive of Britney and all of her endeavors, but he’s trying to distance himself from her upcoming book,” a source <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>told Us Weekly</a>. “It’s not something he’s focusing too much on in terms of anything she might discuss when it comes to their former relationship.”</p><p>Ahead of the huge bombshells revealed by People before its launch, the *NSYNC star was said to be somewhat dreading its release. “Justin’s not going to be happy,” a source told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Us Weekly</a>, hinting that Spears “goes after him hard.” But “it’s not Britney’s intention to skewer anyone,” added a third source. “She’s just going to relay the facts from her perspective.”</p><p>Indeed, that aligns with what other sources revealed. “[Justin]’s very curious what she’ll reveal from their relationship,” one source <a href=# rel=nofollow>explained to Page Six</a>. “It’s eating at him.” Another said that the book isn’t a “takedown” of anyone. “This is Britney finally getting a chance to tell her empowering story,” they said, “and it’s nothing more than that.”</p><p>Sources told <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.etonline.com/justin-timberlake-focusing-on-his-own-family-amid-britney-spears-book-and-abortion-claim-213172 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> that Justin’s main focus is his family. “Justin has been focusing on his own family and trying not to concern himself with Britney’s memoir,” the source says. “In recent years, Justin has tried to be supportive of Britney from a distance. They dated so long ago, but he still has respect for her. Justin and Jessica just want everyone to grow and evolve instead of continuing to bring up the past.”</p><p>By far the biggest revelation in&nbsp;The Woman in Me, Britney revealed that she was pregnant with his baby during the relationship, but they decided to get an abortion. “I loved Justin so much. I always expected us to have a family together one day. This would just be much earlier than I’d anticipated,” she wrote. “But Justin definitely wasn’t happy about the pregnancy. He said we weren’t ready to have a baby in our lives, that we were way too young.”</p><p>The pop icon admitted that she “agreed not to have the baby” but seemed to have some regrets about the decision they made more than 20 years ago. “I don’t know if that was the right decision. If it had been left up to me alone, I never would have done it,” she revealed. “And yet Justin was so sure that he didn’t want to be a father.”</p><p>On the topic of Justin, Britney also revealed how they shared their first kiss. Alongside Justin, Britney joined The All-New Mickey Mouse Club when she was 11 years old in 1992. She described it as “honestly a kid’s dream — unbelievably fun, particularly for a kid like me. But it was also exceptionally hard work: we would run choreography thirty times in a day, trying to get every step perfect.” She shared a dressing room with Christina Aguilera and looked up to the older cast members like Keri Russell, Ryan Gosling, and Ryan Lucca.</p><p>Though she disclosed that behind the scenes, there was a start of her relationship with co-star Justin Timberlake. “[Once] at a sleepover, we played Truth or Dare, and someone dared Justin to kiss me. A Janet Jackson song was playing in the background as he leaned in and kissed me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfn8K0wMinZK2hnZeys7jApJxmmqKewa%2Bx2GaqqZ2Rp8Buw86mmKdlmaN6rrGO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjustin-timberlake-britney-spears-woman-in-me.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjustin-timberlake-britney-spears-woman-in-me.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjustin-timberlake-britney-spears-woman-in-me.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjustin-timberlake-britney-spears-woman-in-me.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjustin-timberlake-britney-spears-woman-in-me.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjustin-timberlake-britney-spears-woman-in-me.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./index-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./index-html.html>Kari Lake - Latest news, breaking stories and comment</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./cobra-kai-mary-mouser-ethan-cutkosky-hot-topic.html>Cobra Kai's Mary Mouser and Shameless' Ethan Cutkosky Celebrate Halloween with Hot Topic</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./cobra-kai-mary-mouser-ethan-cutkosky-hot-topic.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
