Struggling to find his place, Salazar befriends the adorably quirky Felix Weston (<strong>Anthony Turpel</strong>)<strong> </strong>and soon adjusts to his life living in a new town.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But things get complicated when Victor finally comes out to his conservative Christian family. While they try their best to accept him for who he is, it's still apparent that they are struggling with the situation. Victor's problems don't end there. He still needs to sort out his true feelings for Benjamin "Benji" Campbell (<strong>George Sear</strong>), reconcile with his heartbroken ex-girlfriend Mia Brooks (<strong>Rachel Naomi Hilson</strong>), and above all, survive the ups and downs of high school. Plus, with graduation in the air, time might just be ticking for Victor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Taking place in the same universe as the feature film <strong>Love, Simon</strong></a>, the series is also inspired by the young adult novel <strong>Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda </strong>by <strong>Becky Albertalli</strong>. While it started with a simple plot in Season 1, the storylines become much richer and even more complex in Season 2. Victor and Benji are the leading romantic duo, but Love, Victor also highlights the backgrounds of every character and shows their unique struggles. Everyone is trying to figure out who they want to be in their lives and what they truly want.</p><p>Before catching up on all three seasons of Love, Victor<a href=#>on both Disney+ and Hulu</a>, check out our cast and character guide below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/love-victor-first-look.jpg><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="Why 'Love, Victor' Needed to Show the After of Victor and Benji's Happy Ending">Why 'Love, Victor' Needed to Show the After of Victor and Benji's Happy Ending</a></span></p><h2 id=michael-cimino-as-victor-salazar>Michael Cimino as Victor Salazar</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/love-victor-season-3-michael-cimino.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Michael Cimino plays Victor Salazar, the main character of the show. Originally hailing from Texas, the half-Puerto Rican, half-Colombian-American teen recently moved to Shady Creek, Georgia, along with his entire family. Victor is currently the oldest of his three siblings. As he adjusts to life as a sophomore at Creekwood High School, he plays on the school's basketball team (eventually becoming a star player) and works as a barista at Brasstown Coffee Company on the side.</p><p>Victor may appear to be the mysterious new kid at school, but he is simply trying to figure things out. He has many unanswered questions about himself, the majority of which concern his sexuality. Despite dating Mia earlier in the show, he eventually develops feelings for Benji. Aside from the confusion, it's no secret that Victor is a kind-hearted and funny man who will not hesitate to lend a listening ear to his family and friends. But don't take advantage of his niceness. Victor will still stand up for his beliefs, even if it means going against his family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Cimino previously appeared in <strong>Annabelle Comes Home</strong> as Bob Palmeri</a> and <strong>Centurion XII</strong> as Miguel.</p><h2 id=rachel-naomi-hilson-as-mia-brooks>Rachel Naomi Hilson as Mia Brooks</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Rachel-Hilson-love-victor-1.jpg><p>Rachel Naomi Hilson plays Mia Brooks, a popular and well-liked Crestwood student whose best friend is Lake Meriwether (<strong>Bebe Wood</strong>). Brooks falls for Victor when he starts his sophomore year at her school and eventually starts dating him. However, Hilson's heart is broken when she sees Victor kissing Benjamin "Benji" Campbell (George Sear). Later in the season, Brooks begins dating Andrew, who has long harbored romantic feelings for her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brooks does not come from a happy family. Her father, Harold, is usually away on business, leaving her alone at home. Meanwhile, her mother is an artist with a more free-spirited personality. Even though she deeply cares for Harold and Brooks, she realizes she is no longer compatible with her husband and leaves them without a word. Things get even more complicated when Harold announces his engagement to his new girlfriend and a more lucrative job offer in California.</p><p>Hilson previously portrayed Beth Clark in <strong>This Is Us</strong> and Nicole Patterson in <strong>Kings</strong>.</p><h2 id=anthony-turpel-as-felix-weston>Anthony Turpel as Felix Weston</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/anthony-turpel-love-victor-1.jpg><p>Anthony Turpel plays Felix Weston, another resident of the apartment building the Salazars move into. Weston is funnily adorable. Weston is hilariously adorable. He's eccentric, funny, and even has a DJ persona called DJ F-Bomb. He has the appearance of an eager puppy and a sweet old grandfather. His clothes, too, reflect his old-soul vibe. But beneath it, all is a dark past. Weston has lived with his single mother since he was a child and has seen his mother suffer from manic depression, which worsens throughout the season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Weston becomes close friends with Victor after moving into the same apartment building.

She is obsessed with fashion and is always on the lookout for new brands and pop culture. Initially, she keeps her relationship with Weston a secret, but she gradually gains confidence in showing it to everyone else. Meriwether becomes concerned about Weston having to care for his mother on his own, which causes several issues.

Spencer is the series' "not-so-nice-guy," the typical jock from a wealthy family who drives a nice expensive car. However, Spencer has a complicated relationship with his father, who mostly ignores his son but loves to show him off at important events. Spencer likes to make fun of other people and call them insulting nicknames at school, to which Weston and Meriwether retort that he's not funny and that the only person laughing is himself.</p><p>He is initially unaware of his negative traits, but tries to change after asking Brooks if he is a good person, to which she replies, "I think deep down you're a good guy, but I don't think that matters much if on the surface you're a total jerk."

Benji is a gay student who has been out for much longer than Victor. However, that doesn't mean his journey hasn't been difficult. Campbell develops an unhealthy drinking habit before coming out to his family, which leads to him becoming inebriated and crashing his father's car into a Wendy's. Since coming out, he isn't close to his father as they used to be. He is a Creekwood High School student who is also the lead singer of his band, The Sticky Beaks, and works as an assistant manager and barista at Brasstown Coffee Company. Campbell attends AA meetings and has a sponsor to help him recover from his drinking habits. He has one year of sobriety under his belt right now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Friendly, thoughtful, and considerate, Campbell quickly bonds with new student Victor and develops feelings for him. He openly expresses his feelings for Victor by singing a song for him during the Battle of the Bands competition and giving him a portrait for his birthday, but things become complicated when Victor kisses Campbell. Campbell was in a relationship with his bandmate, Derek, prior to the series premiere, but things became strained when the couple hit some rough patches.
