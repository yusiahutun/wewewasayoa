Outside Spain, it could be found in a few other countries in Europe and Asia – notably Japan – but the label had little to no presence in key markets such as the US or China. It was a sleeping beauty waiting to be awakened, and Anderson was the one to bring it back to life and give it a much needed dose of energy.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">How Tommy Hilfiger’s Hong Kong connection helped build the brand – interview</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’ll never forget the first show I did. It was the first big job that I had, at the Unesco [headquarters in Paris], and it was very interesting to do this thing that I never dreamed I’d be able to do for this giant group. And looking at it now, I stand by that collection,” Anderson tells Style during a recent visit to Shanghai. “It was an exciting moment. When I took over Loewe nobody thought it was going to work and I remember that moment quite fondly.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/10/9e9bc540-575e-499b-bf0a-e26c9dbc1256_4c3bc3f2.jpg><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1eav71q e1haapfp2">The brand was incredibly tiny when I joined and a lot of people probably thought that this was never going to work … I feel I’ve done my job and it was what Loewe needed</figure>The 39-year-old designer <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">is in China’s fashion hub for the unveiling of “Crafted World”, an exhibition charting the history of Loewe</span></a>, and celebrating his remarkable 10-year run at the house. After closing in Shanghai in early May, the show will make stops around the world. Given the setting, he was in a nostalgic mood and a bit emotional at the prospect of presenting the world his work for a brand that is now so closely associated with his own creative prowess, and called working on the exhibition, conceived in collaboration with Dutch architecture firm OMA, “cathartic”.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When you’re at a brand for 10 years and the brand has been around since 1846, it’s very easy to forget what you were doing, and this is a very important chance to understand all the things that I had picked up at the very beginning and all the things that had influenced me at the brand,” says Anderson. “Are they still relevant today?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/11/94dc2705-5329-4150-82da-db3b84bf4552_52ae140e.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Looking at Anderson’s body of work for Loewe in a museum-like setting feels quite appropriate. Not long after taking over, Anderson redefined Loewe as a “cultural brand”, harking back to the company’s early days as a cooperative of artisans that prized craftsmanship and the making of beautiful objects (the name came later, after German craftsman Enrique Loewe joined the fold in 1876). Anderson’s love for crafts and “underserved” disciplines such as weaving and pottery has always been a key influence on his work. Unlike designers chasing after the hot artist of the moment for trend-driven collaborations, Anderson is very thoughtful about the creatives he works with.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Who wore it best?

Of course, I could tell you about Andy Warhol but <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">everyone knows about Andy Warhol</span></a> [but], there are people who are just as great as Andy – like Lynda Benglis, one of the most important feminist sculptors in the world who fundamentally changed American sculpture in the 70s,” says Anderson.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/10/307298cc-d750-4ef4-8971-f3c9f45b5220_f127e1ec.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Sometimes I feel that when brands do already big names you’re re-commercialising the commercial, so end up telling a story that everybody knows. There’s nothing more exciting than telling the unfamiliar. It’s nice to get people to engage in something they don’t know; my job is to be curious about something I don’t know, every day.”</p>Rather than pandering to an elite group of art aficionados, Anderson’s culture-driven approach welcomes in mass appreciation, and this ability to combine cultural cachet with commercial savvy has made him one of the most influential designers of the 21st century. Just look at how far Loewe has come since he took over 10 years ago, when the brand was almost a nonentity when compared to its <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">sister LVMH labels such as Dior, Fendi or even Givenchy</span></a>. Loewe is now one of the best performing brands at LVMH and often ranks as one of the top three brands on the Lyst Index, a quarterly ranking of fashion’s hottest brands and products. From a hit collaboration with trainer label On to <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">red-carpet endorsements from A-list celebrities such as Rihanna</span></a> and Zendaya, the brand has been on a roll in recent years.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">10 most popular luxury brands in the world, ranked – but which is No 1?</span></p></a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/10/4a4dbff0-136d-44b4-93e4-bd29bd9f6ad4_e12a3514.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I always knew that Loewe was going to work but never believed that it was going to transcend this far, and to be here and see a billboard and a giant exhibition and everything together. It’s quite a surreal thing,” says Anderson. “The brand was incredibly tiny when I joined and a lot of people probably thought that this was never going to work and now coming here I feel I’ve done my job and it was what Loewe needed.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">The award goes to … A-listers rocking archival fashion on red carpets</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Now a household name in fashion circles, Anderson is aware of the impact he’s had on Loewe but at the same time, he is adamant that the brand is bigger than any one designer and he sees that achievement as a barometer of his success.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This brand will survive without me because it has survived without me since it was born in 1846 – it’s just a new chapter now. What’s important is that whatever people’s knowledge of the brand is in today’s world, it has to have a fundamental DNA,” says Anderson. “A lot of people don’t know that I do it. They know it as a brand and buy this bag because it has this name on it – I’ve built a world around it to sell that, so I’m just a custodian to the whole thing. When I started the job I’ve always believed that if you’re a very good designer you’re able to create something that is able to surpass yourself.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/10/e5486ab7-4459-439b-8196-833d277d45ad_4c3bc3f2.jpg>Anderson’s modest view of his accomplishments at Loewe may come across as a “humblebrag”, but it’s actually an example of his laserlike focus on brand building. The designer came of age at a pivotal time in the industry when luxury groups asserted their power and designers became guns for hire who had to deliver results for their parent companies. While Anderson prizes creativity and innovation above all else and does not shy away from indulging in flights of fancy at his <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">always talked-about runway shows</span></a>, he is very pragmatic and knows that he has a job to do and expectations to meet.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/10/2dec6cb6-f8c3-4f09-8326-ae7c8e8b2dcc_4c3bc3f2.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The pandemic was a moment when we realised that we could lose everything and at the same time we could gain everything,” he says. “For me it was a wake-up call because I had been at the brand for seven or eight years and when the pandemic happened I didn’t know where I was going, and at that moment we started doing the shows in boxes. I felt like, let’s slow everything down and if we’re going to survive through this we have to do things differently. It was a turning point for me and for the brand because I think everyone realised that if we were to be a creative entity we had to be the best to make it work; it was [empowering].”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The pandemic also played a key role in the genesis of “Crafted World”. Anderson was in Shanghai in December 2019, just before the world came to a halt, and was already thinking about doing something in China. “That was the end of an old world and the beginning of a new world, so I wanted to go back and say, if we’re going to do this exhibition, let’s do it far away so we have some distance from it and at the same time we can create something new,” he says.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Making waves: surfer girl fashion is back – from Chanel to Miu Miu</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We do so much in Europe and it’s a bit annoying that we don’t do as much outside; I don’t do this just for Europeans. China is a new market for us and, because what I built is not just straightforward, I want people to understand why Loewe is an amazing brand – when people go into this world and they leave, they hopefully realise they’re not just buying something with the name Loewe but because of this entire universe.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/10/cfad0865-7171-4e12-acdd-07a14f741e4b_f127e1ec.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Far from jaded, Anderson still talks about Loewe as if he’s just discovering the storied maison that he single-handedly turned into a global powerhouse. There’s no question that he has left an indelible mark on the brand and on what Loewe means to luxury consumers in Asia and beyond. He is very matter of fact about the reality that one day his role as “custodian” will come to an end but is also confident that the foundations he has built are strong enough to propel the success of Loewe as it enters its next chapter.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I want people to go into a store and see something they’ve never seen before. It could be a sculpture, a ceramic, it has to be something that is not just about the brand, so I hope that when people come to this exhibition they will see one object they’ve never seen before, even if it’s just one, and if it inspires you, great,” says Anderson. “If someone young sees something that inspires them then Loewe and the entire team have done an amazing job.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZqmdn6W5pnvLrq%2BuqqlisKa70miYq6yZmLmme5JrbHFtYGZ8rbvEsJxmoJmctbR5yailmqyYlrturc2dnKurn6N6rbvOpKpmmpGYuG6xz6KaZpyVmK6lsYycqZ6ZpJ7DpnnDoqmem6Skv27AwKWirGWRp8Futc2sp6Kqkam2sLqMmqWd</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2floewe-highs-jonathan-anderson-looks-back-epic-decade-creative-director-talks-art-inspiration-and.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2floewe-highs-jonathan-anderson-looks-back-epic-decade-creative-director-talks-art-inspiration-and.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2floewe-highs-jonathan-anderson-looks-back-epic-decade-creative-director-talks-art-inspiration-and.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2floewe-highs-jonathan-anderson-looks-back-epic-decade-creative-director-talks-art-inspiration-and.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2floewe-highs-jonathan-anderson-looks-back-epic-decade-creative-director-talks-art-inspiration-and.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2floewe-highs-jonathan-anderson-looks-back-epic-decade-creative-director-talks-art-inspiration-and.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-to-get-matte-lipstick-off.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-to-get-matte-lipstick-off.html>How to Get Matte Lipstick Off</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./little-mix-jade-thirlwall-crop-top-leather-trousers.html>Little Mix's Jade Thirlwall stuns in high-waisted leather trousers</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./little-mix-jade-thirlwall-crop-top-leather-trousers.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
