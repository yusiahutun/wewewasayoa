The Tamagotchi Uni is the newest version of the 90s classic toy which parents will remember. My daughter is absolutely obsessed with hers - I love the fact that it’s wearable as a watch which tracks your movements so you can take it for a walk or meet up with friends and the fact that it’s rechargeable via USB cable is a massive plus too (we had the previous generation Tamagotchi Pix which burned through batteries at an alarming rate) This is a unique gift that all kids will love, whatever they’re into - the joy you get watching the little creature grow and evolve is immense.</p></li><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8cfb69b603e6-bitzee-virtual-pet.jpg><p><h2 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">A unique digital pet you can touch</h2></p><p dir=ltr><strong>Ages: </strong>5 and up</p><p>My kids are big fans of Tamagotchis, but Ive never seen them so excited over a toy as when they tested out Bitzee. It’s a digital pet with a difference as you can actually touch it - it reacts to swipes, tilts and touches. The concept is the same as with most digi pets - it starts as a baby and you have to take care of it - feed it, play with it - even rock it to sleep, and it grows into an adult - and the more you play, the more pets you unlock. It comes in a ring-style box, which you open - and the floating image of your pet appears. It was a real novelty for my kids. They completed the training lesson easily, and enjoyed filling up the ‘love’ meter to evolve the pets and unlocking mini games to progress their Bitzie’s even further. The pets include common (bunny, cat, hedgehog, snail), rare (butterfly, chameleon) and legendary (mercat, unicorn) - and they’re all super adorable! And for me, the big plus point (apart from the reasonable price) is that with Bitzee, when the box is closed, the pet is ‘sleeping’ and doesn’t make any demands until you open it again.</p></li><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/254b24c028ee-monkey-see-monkey-poo.jpg><p><h3 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">A Christmas present idea for monkey fans</h3></p><p dir=ltr><strong>Ages: </strong>4 and up</p><p dir=ltr>This is a really silly vertical family board game for two to four players which will appeal to anyone who loves monkeys, or finds toilet humour funny (isn’t that everyone??) The game will be over in about 25-30 minutes, but my two kids wanted to play it again and again. You spin the wheel to see how many flings you get, then load the bana-scented ‘poo’ into the monkey flinger and launch it at the tree to collect banana tokens. Depending on how many tokens you get, move you monkey up the vine, and the first to the top wins. My kis are six and ten and they love playing it together, and I think this would be good for younger kids to get them counting and recognising numbers.</p></li><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dd56e8ade429-enchanted-treehouse-lego.jpg><p><h2 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">The ultimate LEGO set for Disney fans</h2></p><p><strong>Ages: </strong>7 and up</p><p>Disney Fans will adore this thousand-piece set - and it's a great one because not only will they spend hours making it, but they'll be playing with it for months to come. Although it's marked as for ages seven and above, my six-year-old is managing it - with a little help here and there. Even the ten-year-old boy is interested, despite the high Disney Princess count. To be precise, it features the characters Mulan, Raya, Elsa, Moana, Tinker Bell, Alice, Wendy, Belle, Tiana, Anna, Pocahontas, Princess Jasmine and Mirabel, so there's a lot to play with!</p></li><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0e4662315268-pop-bracelet-maker.jpg><p><h2 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">A present idea for jewellery fans</h2></p><p dir=ltr><strong>Ages:</strong> 7 and up</p><p dir=ltr>If your kid loves bracelets, and especially making bracelets, they’ll love this little kit. It’s reccomended for ages seven and up, but my six-year-old had no problem using it - I was actually surprised at how easy it is to use! You can make, and remake, 10 unique friendship bracelets using the 170 pop-on beads. There’s no cutting, collapse or even having to tie knots - so it’s very user friendly. It’s a very creative unique gift for kids that’s a great one to get them away from screens and computer games. It’s just a shame you can’t buy refills of the beads, but hopefully it’ll be something the manufacturer brings out in the future.</p></li><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/908770597cf5-air-fort.jpg><p><h3 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">The Christmas gifts for kids to enjoy with friends</h3></p><p><strong>Ages:&nbsp;</strong>3 years and up</p><p>Kids love hanging out in tents and dens, but this really takes it to the next level. it's an inflatable air fort, which is ready for play in seconds - you just switch on the fan and it's filled with air. No messing about with poles, and there's no floor so it's easily accessible for kids of all ages. A brilliant toy for sleepovers, playrooms and sure to be the fave hangout spot in the house. We love the starry night version, but it's available in plenty of other designs too!</p></li><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/60f287a39a92-unicorn-book-z.jpg><p><h3 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">Best personalised gift idea for kids</h3></p><p><strong>Ages:</strong> suitable for all ages</p><p>A unique gift idea for kids that puts them in the spotlight – this is perfect.

They conduct an annual survey exploring the attitudes and behaviours of kids aged 8-15 years who use the internet. This is done by interviewing children and their parents/guardians. They gave us insights exploring trends specifically among eight to 11-year-olds in the UK. &nbsp;A few of the interesting things we discovered? The number of kids who play Mario has grown by 29% since 2021, the number of kids who would ask for jewellery as a present is up 23% since 2021, and those saying Barbie is a favourite toy has almost doubled since 2021.&nbsp;</p><p id=es1eBmdv-pVN5 data-wc=91>Star Wars is also growing in popularity. Chris Beer, data journalist at GWI says: "One of the strongest trends in the last few years has been households signing up to Disney+, and with the amount of Star Wars IP on the service, kids are getting more and more into its characters. Action figures, plushies, and LEGO sets are all likely to be popular. Baby Yoda and Yoda are the most popular Star Wars characters and are now liked by more UK kids than old favourites Superman, Captain Marvel, and Mickey Mouse."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfqLWwvM%2BipaBnZWWEcn%2BQaJmeq6Riwq%2B10K6cZp%2BZm8FutcOemKxllqS%2FbrfInapo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-unique-gift-ideas-for-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-unique-gift-ideas-for-kids.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-unique-gift-ideas-for-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-unique-gift-ideas-for-kids.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-unique-gift-ideas-for-kids.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-unique-gift-ideas-for-kids.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./christmas-kids-table-ideas.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./christmas-kids-table-ideas.html>40 Best Christmas Games &amp;amp; Activities for Kids</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ralph-macchio-wife.html>Ralph Macchio and Wife Have the Cutest Love Story</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ralph-macchio-wife.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
