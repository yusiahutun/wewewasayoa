As for today’s topic, Amber Laign found love with her partner of the same sex and has been together with her for over the span of 15 years.</span></p><p><span>Amber Laign is a professional massage therapist and fashion enthusiast. She is popularly known for being the partner of television broadcaster Robin Roberts.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Amber Laign Relationship Details With Robin Roberts</strong></span></h2><p><span>Though Amber Laign and Robin Roberts have not been married or engaged, they have been together for over a decade. The couple shares such a sweet romance despite their 14 year age gap, with Roberts being the older one than Laign.</span></p><p><span>Amber and her partner Robin first linked during 2005 when their <a href=# rel=noopener>mutual friend</a> set them up for a blind date. Romance bloomed between them soon after; however, they didn’t publicly announce it until 2013, when Robin came out as gay.</span></p><p><span>Robin posted a lengthy caption on her Facebook account at the time, while she expressed her gratitude for “God,” her sister, Sally-Ann, friends, family, and her “long time girlfriend, Amber.” The post came after nearly four months of Robin’s recovery after transplanting bone marrow as a part of her treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome.</span></p><p><span>Ever since the couple has been a bit not so more but still the free and outgoing couple, they, sometimes, have a public appearance as a couple and do some vacationing together. They have had been to several Asian countries together over the past years for their vacation, such as in South Korea and Vietnam, to name a few.</span></p><p><span>Amber also attended her partner’s niece’s wedding together back in 2014, together with Robin. Moreover, Robin shared her first photo of her girlfriend Amber on ABC’s Good Morning America while exclaiming her happiness and joy to go public with her relationship.</span></p><p><span>Last year, the <a href=# rel=noopener>pair celebrated</a> their 15th anniversary since their first meet. Amber took to her Instagram to recall her lovely moment of the year 2005, the time of their first meeting.</span></p><p><span>As for Robin’s part of the surprise, she gifted Amber a pair of personalized crystal champagne glasses and a bottle of champagne, which was shared to her Instagram account during their special day last year. The broadcaster also gave Amber a mouth-watering and stunning cake, which featured a chocolate frosting and the words<strong> “Happy Anniversary Heey!”</strong></span></p><p><span>And lastly, Robin also presented her gifts with a card that read, <strong>“Sweet Amber, I’ll stand by you, all my love, RR,”</strong> while she shared Amber’s lengthy and sweet tribute to her on her own Instagram account. Alongside the shared post, Robin posted a series of photos of them together, writing, <strong>“15 photos for 15 years. RR had this printed with my favourite song in the centre onto a canvas so that will soon hang over my desk.”</strong></span></p><p><span>During the 2014’s interview of Robin with The Ellen DeGeneres Show, she also gushed about how her girlfriend is “very, very supportive and she’s been right there beside me, every step of the way.”</span></p><p><span>The couple reportedly resides together in Connecticut, USA, - where they own a gorgeous mansion. Robin gave some glimpses of her mansion during the pandemic via her social media accounts. One featured a sweet photo shoot of her with Amber with their stunning garden as a background which featured themselves advertising their Instagram Live about Amber’s business.</span></p><p><span>While Robin has to split her time between Manhattan during weekdays for her works and Connecticut, she recently enjoyed a mini-break with her partner Amber. Earlier in June this year, the pair had a beautiful time bike riding together just by the beach, and later that day, Amber also went on to post a sweet selfie of them together with a stunning ocean background.</span></p><p><span>Besides, the pair also spent the recent pandemic lockdown of 2020 together in the Connecticut mansion. And earlier this year, Robin tells PEOPLE of their time together during the pandemic being more than the “previous 15 years combined. We’ve never been stronger,” as she explained that being patient helped her enjoy her time with Amber.</span></p><p><span><a href=# rel=noopener>She continued</a>, <strong>“I hate that saying ‘Stay in the moment’, but it forced me to do that. I’m grateful,”</strong> while also expressing her utmost gratitude for her ABC morning show cast and crews for tagging along with her at the time.</span></p><p><span>Last month, the couple reached a new milestone in their relationship. Celebrating their 16 years of togetherness, Robin took to her Instagram account to share a loving video clip of them, as she dedicated a sweet message to her longtime partner Amber.</span></p><h2><span><strong>How Much Is Amber Laign Net Worth?</strong></span></h2><p><span>Though Amber Laign may not be as popular as her partner Robin Roberts, she is still a working adult with licensed professionalism in some fields, like massage therapist, which earns her cash.</span></p><p><span>Moreover, she earned some wealth from her previous work in the fashion field for Berger & Stevens, Apparel store as a sales representative for nine years. While her exact net worth is not known, informationcradle.com <a href=# rel=noopener>estimated her net worth</a> to be around $1 million as of 2020.</span></p><p><span>Her partner, however, boasts a significantly higher net worth than herself which is reported to be $45 million, as per CelebrityNetWorth. A part of her earnings adds up via her salary from anchoring in the ABC’s Good Morning America, which was <a href=# rel=noopener>reported to be</a> $18 million per year.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Amber Laign Early Life And Parents</strong></span></h2><p><span>Born on 6 September 1974, in California, USA, Amber is a gay woman.
