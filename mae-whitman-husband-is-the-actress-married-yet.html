The two were traversing the treacherous world of memories, obsessions, fears, and fantasies that lives inside their heads, and just discovering that their greatest obstacle to finding happiness together might just be themselves!</span></p><p><span>But this was just on screen. What about Mae Whitman’s real life? Does the actress have a husband? Or is she even married yet? Find answers as you scroll down.</span></p><h3><b>Mae Whitman Husband: Is The Actress Married Yet?</b></h3><p><span>No, as of 2023, Mae Whitman wasn’t married. This meant she didn’t have a husband. However, she was rumored to be dating Dov Tiefenbach then (which we’ll further discuss below).</span></p><p><span>Guess, the actress still had a lot to do before setting down for good. Or, it just could be that she was busy and never had time to think about a husband.</span></p><p><span>The last we checked, Mae was portraying “Lindsay” in </span><i><span>Up Here</span></i><span> alongside her on-screen boyfriend Carlos Valdes. The show was based on Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, a super accomplished musical theater couple’s own romance.</span></p><h3><b>Mae Whitman Relationship Status</b></h3><p><span>Mae Whitman was rumored to be dating the Canadian actor, Dov Tiefenbach. However, till the time of writing this article, nothing concrete ever came out to substantiate the gossip.</span></p><p><span>Infact, Mae and Dov were speculated to be dating ever since 2008. But there were reports that Mae has had a few romances with other personas in the middle.&nbsp; Confusingly enough, a 2019 article by Ranker suggested they were in a relationship and that they might have been together since 2008.</span></p><p><span>Her rumored boyfriend, Dov was born on December 8, 1981, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Acting since the age of 12, he finally launched his breakout role as Josh Avery in the television series </span><i><span>RoboCop</span></i><span> (1994). Then the next year, he starred as Murray Murray in the short film </span><i><span>Love Child </span></i><span>(1995) alongside actress Neve Campbell and hit the spotlight.</span></p><h3><b>Mae Whitman Dating History</b></h3><p><span>Dov Tiefenbach was Mae Whitman first rumored boyfriend.</span></p><p><span>Then came musician Landon Pigg whom the actress dated during the filming of </span><i><span>Parenthood</span></i><span>. In an interview with Glamour, Mae confessed that they were still together when Landon made a cameo in Season 3, Episode 10, which aired in 2011. But she never revealed why or when they broke up.</span></p><p><span>In her words, “Actually my ex-boyfriend Landon was on [Parenthood] one year. He was my boyfriend at the time, and he came on the Luncheonetteto record because he was a musician.”</span></p><p><span>The ex-lovers are now on good terms. “We’re still really good friends. He actually helped me write all the music that I’ve sung on this show so far. To have him on the show was pretty special,” she said.</span></p><p><span>Post Landon, Mae was then rumored to have linked with Miles Heizer. But that was just fans at work! However, it was the duo (who were co-stars for six seasons of</span><i><span> Parenthood</span></i><span>) themselves who started the fire. At the time, Mae and Miles both made an IG post, captioned, “13 years and we still can’t keep our hands off each other,” and “some things last a long time,” respectively.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, the two were just good friends in real life and the snaps were some kind of a prank for their followers.</span></p><p><span>Now, for those who don’t know, Mae is pansexual. The </span><i><span>Up Here</span></i><span> star once even once spoke up on Twitter stating the importance of queer representation in&nbsp; Disney’s </span><i><span>Owl House</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>“Just taking a moment to say I am SO proud to be even a small part of a show like The Owl House. Being pansexual myself, I wish I had such incredible characters like Amity and Luz in my life when I was growing up. Queer representation is sososo important:,) keep it up world,” she wrote.</span></p><p><span>The actress even emphasized the meaning of pansexuality, “I know ppl might be unfamiliar with what pansexual means; for me, it means I know I can fall in love with people of all genders.”</span></p><p><span>However, though she’s equally attracted to girls and guys, she had never been in a same-sex relationship until 2023.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>How Old Is Mae Whitman?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Mae was born on June 9, 1988, in Los Angeles, California, USA.
