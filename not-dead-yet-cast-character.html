When Nell moved back to California after her failed relationship, she was assigned as a writer for obituaries at a So-Cal Independent. Stressed by the move, her new roommate situation, and the disappointing position at work, she starts to get visited by ghosts of the recently deceased who can only move on when she publishes their eulogy.</p><p>Gina Rodriguez began her acting career in 2004 with a screen debut in an episode of<strong> Law & Order</strong>. Her breakthrough came in 2012 with the independent musical-drama film <strong>Filly Brown</strong>. She is best known for her Golden Globe-winning role as Jane Villanueva in <a href=#><strong>Jane the Virgin</strong></a>. However, you may recognize Rodriguez from her extensive filmography like <strong>Deepwater Horizon</strong>, <strong>Annihilation</strong>,<strong> Miss Bala</strong>, <strong>Someone Great</strong>, <strong>Scoob!</strong>, and <strong>Awake</strong>. She also voiced <strong>Carmen Sandiego</strong> in the Netflix animated series. Now, Rodriguez has an <a href=#>upcoming lead role in the movie <strong>Players</strong>,</a> where she also serves as an executive producer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hannah-simone-as-sam>Hannah Simone as Sam</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hannah-simone-not-dead-yet-season-2.jpg><p><strong>Hannah Simone</strong> plays Sam, Nell’s best friend and her coworker who helps bring her on to the team at So-Cal Independant. She’s the style editor for the news outlet and has a history with Nell as well as their other coworkers.</p><p>In 2005 Simone started her career as the host of HGTV Canada's <strong>Space for Living</strong>, but she gained widespread recognition for her portrayal of Cece in <a href=#><strong>New Girl</strong></a>. Beyond television, she explored the film industry with roles in projects like <strong>Oldboy</strong> and <strong>Band Aid</strong>. For her most recent role, she voiced Pinky in <strong>Mira, Royal Detective</strong>, and apart from that she hosted a podcast with <strong>Zooey Deschanel </strong><a href=#>(<strong>(500) Days Of Summer</strong>)</a>, and <strong>Lamorne Morris </strong>(<strong>Woke</strong>) called <strong>Welcome to Our Show </strong>where they revisit episodes of New Girl together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lauren-ash-as-lexi>Lauren Ash as Lexi</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/untitled-design-4-1.jpg><p><strong>Lauren Ash</strong> portrays Lexi, as a seriously out-of-touch rich daughter of the newspaper owner. Despite her misgivings and hilarious confidence, deep down she wishes she could earn the respect of her father by making the company in a dead industry succeed.</p><p>Best known for her role as Dina Fox on <a href=#><strong>Superstore</strong></a>, Ash hails from Canada and has two Canadian Comedy Awards for Best Female Improviser in 2006 and 2007, along with awards for Best Performance by a Female in 2012. You might have seen her pranking people on <strong>Scare Tactics</strong>, or performing her parts in <strong>Almost Heroes</strong> and <strong>The Ron James Show</strong>. Ash has also co-hosts the podcast True Crime and Cocktails since 2020 and, aside from acting, anticipates new opportunities with an upcoming screenplay.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rick-glassman-as-edward>Rick Glassman as Edward</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rick-glassman-not-dead-yet-season-2.jpg><p>Nell's roommate Edward, played by <strong>Rick Glassman</strong>, is a bit neurotic, to say the least. He is particular about his things and the apartment they live in and as Nell insinuates, a bit passive-aggressive. He might get under Nell's skin most of the time, however they form a unique bond over time.</p><p>As an actor and comedian, Glassman began his comedic journey at the Cleveland Improv but gained his notoriety with regular performances at The Comedy Store after moving to Los Angeles. He became most widely recognized for his role as Burski in <strong>Undateable</strong>, later creating, writing, directing, and starring in the NBC-produced web series spin-off, <strong>The Sixth Lead</strong>. Glassman portrayed Harold <a href=#>Ramis in the biopic <strong>A Futile and Stupid Gesture</strong></a> and starred in the Amazon Prime Video series <strong>As We See It</strong> but most recently appeared in the Netflix movie <strong>Old Dads</strong> which starred <strong>Bill Burr</strong> (<strong>The King of Staten Island</strong>), <strong>Bobby Cannavale </strong>(<strong>Boardwalk Empire</strong>) and <strong>Bokeem Woodbine</strong> (<strong>Fargo</strong>).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=josh-banday-as-dennis>Josh Banday as Dennis</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/untitled-design-5-1.jpg><p>Nell’s former roommate, long before even moving to the U.K. was Dennis, who is portrayed by <strong>Josh Banday</strong>. Dennis used to be nerdy but through his success became quite cool and on top of it all is Nell’s boss. He knew she’d be able to do the job with no problem so he hired her, but they also have a past and he owed her one.</p><p>Banday is an actor as well as a writer, recognized for his role as Ivan in <strong>Greg Daniels'</strong> Amazon series <strong>Upload. </strong>He has also made appearances on popular shows like <strong>The Big Bang Theory</strong>, <strong>Mom</strong>, <strong>Pam & Tommy</strong>, and <strong>Adam Ruins Everything </strong>as well as contributed as a writer on Not Dead Yet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angela-gibbs-as-cricket>Angela Gibbs as Cricket</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/not-dead-yet-angela-gibbs.jpg><p>As Nell’s position pushes her to meet more and more of the recently deceased, one particular ghost introduces her to his widowed wife, Cricket, portrayed by<strong> Angela Gibbs</strong>.

He overshadows Lexi, and his attitude explains why she is the way she is. With no awareness of his employee's struggles in life and work, his entitlement is laughably absurd.</p><p>Brad Garrett is a staple in the entertainment industry, excelling in stand-up, television, and film. He started his career in stand-up, performing at clubs in Los Angeles, and in 1984 won the grand champion title on <strong>Star Search</strong>. He transitioned into television with notable roles, such as the voice of Hulk Hogan in <strong>Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n Wrestling</strong> but most people will immediately recognize him from his role as Robert Barone on <strong>Everybody Loves Raymond </strong>as Raymond's (<strong>Ray Romano</strong>) brother. Over the years, he has been in various films, including <strong>The Pacifier,</strong> and voiced Gusteau in <strong>Ratatouille</strong>. Recently he had a role in the movie <strong>Wildflower </strong>and will soon voice Ambassador Grigon in the animated sci-fi, <strong>Elio</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=upcoming-guest-appearances-in-lsquo-not-dead-yet-rsquo-season-2>Upcoming Guest Appearances in ‘Not Dead Yet’ Season 2</h2><span class=txt>Close</span><p>According to <a href=#>Variety</a>, in Season 2, guest stars usually appear in a single episode for the most part as Nell’s ghosts. <strong>Wendie Malick</strong>, known for her roles in <strong>Just Shoot Me</strong> and <strong>Dream On</strong>, embodies Mary Sue Manners, host of the fictional show Manners Matter with Mary Sue Manners. Mary Sue is so dedicated to proper etiquette that she dies rather than embarrass herself. Before moving on, Nell helps her loosen up a little.</p><p>Meanwhile, <strong>Nico Santos</strong>, known for <strong>Superstore</strong> and <strong>Crazy Rich Asians</strong>, will portray Teddy. As Pasadena's top realtor, Teddy, in his passing, encourages Nell to gain some confidence in her life and where she’s at. <strong>Rob Corddry</strong>, from <strong>Ballers</strong> and <strong>Childrens Hospital</strong>, takes on the role of Andrew, an unassuming accountant who suspects foul play regarding his death, and convinces Nell to try and solve the mystery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Tommy Martinez</strong>, who is known for <strong>Good Trouble</strong> and <strong>Riverdale</strong>, will play Nell's new love interest, Andres.

Lastly, <strong>Cedric Yarbrough</strong>, notable for "<strong>Lucky Hank</strong>" and <strong>Reno 911!</strong>, portrays Paul, the neighbor who is extremely suspicious about a fellow ghost's death.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Watch on Hulu</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51ku7DAjJ2cmpxdrrK1ecKaqq1lk52us63CrZyrZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fnot-dead-yet-cast-character.html&text=Whos%20in%20the%20Next%20Season%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnot-dead-yet-cast-character.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnot-dead-yet-cast-character.html&title=Whos%20in%20the%20Next%20Season%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fnot-dead-yet-cast-character.html&title=Whos%20in%20the%20Next%20Season%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fnot-dead-yet-cast-character.html&title=Whos%20in%20the%20Next%20Season%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnot-dead-yet-cast-character.html&description=Whos%20in%20the%20Next%20Season%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./assassins-creed-valhalla.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Assassin's Creed Valhalla Archives - Page 5 of 12">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-does-lily-gladstone-play-in-reservation-dogs.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who does Lily Gladstone play in Reservation Dogs?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
