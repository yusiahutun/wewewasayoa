John Stamos is best known for his TV work as Jesse Katsopolis on the sitcom "Full House" (1987-1995), but he also had notable roles on "General Hospital" (1982-1984), "ER" (2005-2009), "Glee" (2010-2011), and "Scream Queens" (2016). He reprised his most famous role on Netflix's "Fuller House," which ran from 2016 to 2020. John was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2009.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>John Stamos was born John Phillip Stamos on August 19, 1963, in Cypress, California. He grew up with mother Loretta (a model), father William (a restaurateur), and younger sisters Janeen and Alaina. William was a Greek immigrant, and his surname was originally Stamatopoulos. When he was growing up, John worked at his father's fast food restaurants, and as a teenager, he worked at Duke's and Yellow Basket in Orange County. While attending <a href=# title="John F. Kennedy Net Worth">John F. Kennedy</a> High School, Stamos played drums in the school's marching band and loved listening to The Beach Boys (who he would end up performing with later in life). John planned to attend Cypress College in 1981, but he decided to focus on an acting career instead and booked a role on "General Hospital" 3 weeks later.</p><h2 id=tv-film-career><strong>TV and Film Career</strong></h2><p>Stamos played Blackie Parrish on soap opera "General Hospital" from 1982 to 1984, earning a Daytime Emmy Award nomination (Outstanding Actor in a Supporting Role in a Daytime Drama Series) and 2 Soapy Awards (Most Exciting New Actor and Outstanding Actor in a Supporting Role). He won lead roles on CBS sitcom "Dreams," which ran for 12 episodes in 1984, and NBC's "You Again?," which aired 26 episodes from 1986 to 1987. In 1986, he made his big screen debut with a starring role in "Never Too Young to Die." John began playing Jesse Katsopolis (aka "Uncle Jesse") on ABC's "Full House" in 1987 and appeared in all 192 episodes of the sitcom's 8 seasons.</p><p>After "Full House" ended, Stamos guest-starred on several TV shows, including "Tales from the Crypt" (1993), "The <a href=# title="Larry Sanders Net Worth">Larry Sanders</a> Show" (1995 and 1997), and "Friends" (2003). He played the lead role on ABC's "Thieves" (2001) and "Jake in Progress" (2005-2006); he also produced both series, a role he would take on again for "Grandfathered" and "Fuller House." Stamos played Dr. Tony Gates on 65 episodes of NBC's "ER" from 2005 to 2009 and landed the lead role on Fox's "Grandfathered," which ran for 22 episodes from 2015 to 2016 and earned him a People's Choice Award for Favorite Actor in a New TV Series. John played a doctor again in 2016, starring as Dr. Brock Holt on season 2 of Fox horror-comedy series "Scream Queens," and that year, he also reprised the role that made him a household name on Netflix's "Fuller House," which ran for 5 seasons. Stamos also landed a notable role on Lifetime's "You" (which moved to Netflix for the second season), playing Dr. Nicky, a therapist with questionable ethics, in 5 episodes (2018 to 2019). Though John is mostly known for his work on television, he has appeared in several films, including "Party Monster" (2003), "Father of Invention" (2010), and "My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2" (2016), and he voiced a penguin in 2007's "Farce of the Penguins," which was directed by "Full House" co-star <a href=# title="Bob Saget Net Worth">Bob Saget</a>.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-303137 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/John-Stamos-1.jpg alt width=900 height=598 sizes="(max-width: 1696px) 100vw, 1696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-303137 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Alberto E.

At 13, he started a band, "Destiny," with some friends, and they performed at parties and amusement parks. Stamos played congas on the 1994 album "Shades of Blue" with fellow musicians Lanny Cordola, David Enos, Gary Griffin, Tony Guerrero, and Sandra Stephens; the album was re-released digitally in 2010. In 2006, John performed <a href=# title="Billy Joel Net Worth">Billy Joel</a>'s "Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)" on the "Unexpected Dreams" charity album, and he has performed with The Beach Boys several times since 1985.

Stamos performed with The Beach Boys on "Dancing with the Stars" in 2010 and during PBS' 2018 "A Capitol Fourth" special, which he also hosted, as well as several dates on their "50th Reunion Tour."</p><h2 id=theatre-career><strong>Theatre Career</strong></h2><p>John made his Broadway debut in a 1995 production of "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying" at the Richard Rodgers Theatre, then went on to appear as the Master of Ceremonies in "Cabaret" (2002) and Guido Contini in "Nine" (2003). In 2009, Stamos starred as Albert Peterson in "Bye Bye Birdie" and won a Golden Icon Award for his performance. He also appeared in "Chance & Chemistry" (2009) and "The Best Man" (2012) on Broadway and played Corny Collins in a 2011 production of "Hairspray" at the Hollywood Bowl.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>John proposed to model/actress <a href=#>Rebecca Romijn</a> on Christmas Eve in 1997, 3 years after meeting her at a Victoria's Secret fashion show. They wed on September 19, 1998, in Beverly Hills and divorced in March 2005. Stamos became engaged to model/actress Caitlin McHugh in October 2017, and they were married on February 3, 2018. John and Caitlin met while guest-starring on "Law and Order: SVU" in 2011, but they did not begin dating until 2015 after McHugh attended a taping of a "Fuller House" episode that her roommate appeared in. John proposed at Disneyland, Caitlin's favorite place, and they welcomed son William on April 10, 2018.</p><p>In 2018, John and Caitlin created a jewelry line, St. Amos Jewelry, donating all the proceeds to Childhelp, a foundation that is dedicated to helping victims of child abuse. Stamos is a huge <a href=# title="Elvis Net Worth">Elvis</a> Presley fan and won a TV Land Award for Favorite Elvis Impression in 2007.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In May 2005, shortly after his divorce from Rebecca Romijn, John purchased a 4,000 square foot home in Beverly Hills for $3.57 million. He listed this home for sale in May 2019 for $6.75 million. Within a few months he lowered the price to $5.7 million, then lowered it again in May 2020 to $4.495 million.</p><p>In 2008 John paid $900,000 for a unit on the 10th floor in the Eastern Columbia building in downtown Los Angeles. Stamos' unit sports 14 foot ceilings, stainless steel appliances, massive tubs, hardwood floors, and an open plan layout.&nbsp; There are hued windows to let in lots of light, and the building provides a great deal of privacy as well. At one point his neighbor in the building was <a href=#>Johnny Depp</a>.</p><p>In August 2019, he purchased a home in a gated community in Hidden Hills, California, for $5.75 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZLewtM1mqq2ZnaTAbrrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjohn-stamos-net-worth.html&text=John%20Stamos%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjohn-stamos-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjohn-stamos-net-worth.html&title=John%20Stamos%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjohn-stamos-net-worth.html&title=John%20Stamos%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjohn-stamos-net-worth.html&title=John%20Stamos%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjohn-stamos-net-worth.html&description=John%20Stamos%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-are-the-trials-of-osiris-rewards-this-week-in-destiny.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What are the Trials of Osiris map and rewards this week in Destiny 2? - February 17, 2023">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-young-and-the-restless.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Avery Bailey Clark">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
