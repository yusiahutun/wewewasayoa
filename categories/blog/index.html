Listeners from the 1970s remember him as the sweet and romantic singer whose tracks always soared to the top of the charts and became ‘Top Ten’ staples. His success and reputation can be measured by the fact that three of his albums went gold, and he was inducted into the ‘Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p><footer><a href=../../cat-stevens.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../gerrymandering.html>Gerrymandering Chris Coyier</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>

In practice, it looks incredibly silly. There are geographical districts that make no sense whatsover, snaking through territory with no other purpose than to bring power to some in-group. An example is an area having some large population of people that vote undesirably, according to a group in power. They can draw lines around them such that they are all districted together such that that district effectively gets “one vote”, instead of having that large population sway multiple districts.</p><footer><a href=../../gerrymandering.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../taylor-swift-new-york.html>Inside Taylor Swift's New York, From Via Carota to Cornelia Street</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>
