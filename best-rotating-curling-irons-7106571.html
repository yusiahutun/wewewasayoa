Spoiler: You can. Rotating curling irons are the hair tools of the future. While many traditional <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>curling irons</a> can help us achieve all our hair goals, “Rotating curling irons are great for someone who isn't advanced or has challenges styling their hair,” says celebrity hair and makeup artist, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Marcia Williams</a>. These innovative devices make styling hair a breeze thanks to their ability to instantly and automatically create curls, utilizing airflow or effortlessly twisting hair around a barrel. No matter how they work, the results are always the same: Luscious, full curls.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, the sheer number of devices on the market is overwhelming. Luckily, we did the hard work for you. We <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>individually tested </a>32 top-rated curling irons and put them through rigorous tests in our lab, trying them on different hair types and carefully examining their ease of use, the amount of tension the clamps had on hair, their value, and their overall performance.

The high tech iron heats up to 450 degrees in less than 35 seconds and features 11 different temperature settings that you can adjust based on your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hair type</a>. It also has two clearly labeled buttons – L and R that determine which direction the iron rotates – making the device simple and convenient to use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from being easy to use, this hot tool also provides hair with gorgeous, voluminous curls. “My curls turned out very nice: They are well-defined and bouncy,” says InStyle tester Nasya. “I could easily brush the curls to get beachy waves if I wanted to as well.” Additionally, thanks to the titanium nano material that the barrel is made with, this tool produces negative ions, which enhance shine and help lock in moisture. As for the cherry on top: This tool has a one-hour automatic shut-down, which means you won’t have to worry if you accidentally leave it on. While the one-inch barrel was perfect for our testing, short hair or those looking for a tighter curl may prefer a difference size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Barrel Size: </strong>1 inch<strong> </strong>|<strong> Heat Settings: </strong>up to 450 degrees<strong> </strong>|<strong> Barrel Material:</strong> Titanium Nano | <strong>Speeds: </strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-luxury-t3-125-inch-twirl-360-curling-iron></span> <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow sponsored noskim" data-retailer-type=SKIMLINKS data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" id=product-record__image_1-0-1 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="T3 1.25 Inch Twirl 360 Curling Iron" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/wnxHb2auxt0c93CpQNmmnE2CxeE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/t3-125-inch-twirl-360-curling-iron-d0755cf267734408bf0de78d207ea894.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>T3</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The T3 Twirl Auto-Rotating Curling Iron is an innovative tool that utilizes gyroscopic technology, which is a fancy way of saying that it curls your hair for you. Here’s the scoop: The iron can sense the motion of your hand. Once it knows which way you’re trying to curl your hair (either way from your face or toward your face), it automatically adjusts its settings. “This tool is so smart — there's only one button to rotate, and it determines which way with the flick of a wrist. I like that because it ensures you don't accidentally press the wrong button and end up curling your hair the wrong way,” former InStyle commerce editor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Mary Honkus</a> says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The result of this smart technology? Luscious, bouncy curls. Plus, thanks to the 1¼ -inch barrel, you can achieve a variety of curl styles (like loose waves, ribbon curls, and more), no matter what length your hair is. On top of that, it has two different rotating speeds, so you can adjust it according to your preference. Although we love this tool, it’s worth noting that it’s not totally intuitive to use unless you read the manual.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Barrel Size: </strong>1¼ -inch |<strong> Heat Settings: </strong>up to 410 degrees<strong> </strong>|<strong> Barrel Material: </strong>Ceramic<strong> </strong>|<strong> Speeds: </strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-maikcq-125-inch-rotating-curling-iron></span> <a href=# rel="noskim noopener nofollow sponsored" data-retailer-type=AMAZON data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" data-amazon-asin=B07VK73QLV id=product-record__image_1-0-2 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="MaikcQ 1.25 Inch Rotating Curling Iron" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/fxFfXE47SckNUk9bKUMrxKlNtOQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/maikcq-125-inch-rotating-curling-iron--7c28c36040394110b350cb209b891105.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Clamp Tension</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Effortless curls are just minutes away when you have this affordable beauty tool. Complete with a ceramic tourmaline barrel that reduces heat damage, seals in moisture, and lessens frizz, this rotating curl iron is all you need to achieve a curly hairstyle. What we love most about this curling iron is that it’s extremely easy to use: It has two buttons on the handle (one with an arrow pointing to the right and another with an arrow pointing to the left) that turn the barrel in your desired direction.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It also has an LCD screen that allows you to see what temperature the tool is at (there are three different temperature settings; low, medium, and high). But, what really sets this device apart is its special brush attachment. This handy tool can be clipped right onto the barrel and used to comb through hair after curling it. The results? Defined, wave-like curls. However, it’s worth noting that the brand only recommends this tool for people with long- and medium-length hair because of its short clamp.&nbsp;Those with shoulder-length hair or above should swap for a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>curling iron for short hair</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Barrel Size: </strong>1¼ -inch<strong> </strong>|<strong> Heat Settings: </strong>410 degrees<strong> </strong>|<strong> Barrel Material: </strong>Ceramic | <strong>Speed: </strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-versatile-shark-flexstyle-air-styling--drying-system></span> <a href=# rel="noskim noopener nofollow sponsored" data-retailer-type=AMAZON data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" data-amazon-asin=B0B89P16MC id=product-record__image_1-0-3 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Shark FlexStyle Air Styling &amp;amp; Drying System" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/xbJBI_p0Cpi4GOy6tyrnbHpUCWo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/shark-air-styling-and-drying-system-e0cdf54287db406b951ce6e13e6f7620.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shark</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Clamp Tension</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.1</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Styling Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This cutting-edge hair tool is ultra-versatile, and allows users to switch between different attachments based on what kind of hairstyle they want to achieve. Choose between a slew of stylers including a handful of brushes (complete with round, oval, and paddle options), as well as a curl diffuser, style concentrator, and wide-tooth comb. Plus, you can also choose two auto-wrap curlers, which are our personal favorites.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These feature the same Coanda airflow technology as the Dyson Airwrap, which instantly wraps hair around the barrel of the curler. Since it utilizes high-speed air instead of high temperatures (like traditional <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>curling wands)</a>, hair is exposed to less heat damage, if any at all. And, even though it doesn’t use high heat, it’s still able to create bouncy, long-lasting curls thanks to its cool shot feature, which helps set and define hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only thing we will point out is that this device comes with two different curling barrels that can only curl hair in one direction (one curls hair to the left and the other curls hair to the right). This means you will have to swap out the barrel if you want to switch the direction of your curls. However, it’s really easy to change between attachments, so this shouldn’t be too much of a hassle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Barrel Size: </strong>1¼ -inch<strong> </strong>|<strong> Heat Settings: </strong>up to 203 degrees<strong> </strong>|<strong> Barrel Material: </strong>Ceramic | <strong>Speeds: </strong>N/A</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-beginners-beachwaver-co-s1-rotating-curling-iron></span> <a href=# rel="noskim noopener nofollow sponsored" data-retailer-type=AMAZON data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" data-amazon-asin=B0B3L5PY79 id=product-record__image_1-0-4 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Beachwaver Co.

Luckily, this smart tool from Beachwaver simplifies the process. “All you have to do is place a one-inch piece of hair under the clamp and hit the button signifying the direction you'd like the curl to go,” former InStyle writer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Caitlyn Martyn </a>explains. Then, it does the rest for you!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Made with a one-inch ceramic barrel that heats up in under one minute, and a small grip clamp that effortlessly holds hair in place while it curls, this iron reduces the time it takes to style your hair. “Though the clamp is small, it manages to hold long hair securely in place while the iron does its job. There’s no tugging, and it releases hair pretty easily, too,” she adds. We appreciate that there are two curling speeds, too (fast and slow), so you can adjust it to your liking.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Barrel Size: </strong>1 inch<strong> </strong>|<strong> Heat Settings: </strong>410 degrees |<strong> Barrel Material: </strong>Ceramic<strong> </strong>|<strong> Speeds: </strong>2</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jessica Juliao</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-loose-curls-the-farrah-rotating-curling-iron></span> <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow nocaes" data-retailer-type=SKIMLINKS data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" id=product-record__image_1-0-5 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The Farrah Rotating Curling Iron" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2RNMGIS4LkoUUvyvCGPjtiX-6R8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/the-farrah-rotating-curling-iron-1-1567a820f30a426797409d8adc1dc796.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>The Farrah</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Clamp Tension</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Farrah Rotating Curling Iron allowed us to achieve the one hairstyle every beauty buff has strived to create at some point in their lives: Loose, naturally chic, and effortless curls. This sleek tool features a one-inch barrel that tames frizz and adds shine, thanks to the ceramic coating. It also has a rotating barrel that doesn’t feature a clamp, which can be easier for beginners to use. Smart technology wraps the hair itself, starting from the top of the head and working its way down towards the ends. (Essentially, to use this tool, hold it next to a one-inch section of hair, starting at the top. Press the button to curl hair, and slowly pull the device down to your ends. Voilà! Effortless curls.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We will note that you can’t see the actual temperature of the tool, rather, a little LED light will illuminate when it’s at 250, 300, 350, 400, or 450 degrees.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Barrel Size: </strong>1 inch<strong> </strong>|<strong> Heat Settings: </strong>up to 450 degrees |<strong> Barrel Material: </strong>Ceramic | <strong>Speeds: </strong>1</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jessica Juliao</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-frizz-tymo-rota-automatic-iconic-hair-curling-wand></span> <a href=# rel="noskim noopener nofollow sponsored" data-retailer-type=AMAZON data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" data-amazon-asin=B09MM24M4T id=product-record__image_1-0-6 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="TYMO Rota Automatic Iconic Hair Curling Wand" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/_ev5CfzKuTiuTn4FrdPdRhNmqIQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tymo-rota-automatic-iconic-hair-curling-wand-534ddcee45304efa96e73f1b1e0118eb.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Clamp Tension</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=3><p>This curler comes with everything you could ever need, including a travel bag, heat-resistant glove, and two hair clips.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Made with a titanium barrel, this curling iron releases negative ions that penetrate the hair, nourishing it from the inside out. These negative ions also seal hair follicles and lock in moisture, ultimately taming and lessening frizz. Aside from the fact that it dramatically reduces static and frizz, we also love that the iron has a handful of great features that make it ideal for anyone to use, from beginners to pros.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For starters, the small clamp firmly holds hair while it rotates; the rotation buttons are easy to recognize and smoothly wrap hair; and there are five different temperature settings (from 280 degrees to 430 degrees), which allow you to adjust the iron to your desired heat. We will note that you can’t actually see the temperature the tool is set to. Rather, it has five lights that indicate which level the tool is set to. To finish it all off, it heats up in under one minute and automatically shuts off after one hour.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Barrel Size: </strong>1 ¼ -inch<strong> </strong>|<strong> Heat Settings: </strong>430 degrees<strong> </strong>|<strong> Barrel Material: </strong>Titanium | <strong>Speeds: </strong>1</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jessica Juliao</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-fine-hair-bio-ionic-stylewinder-rotating-styling-iron></span> <a href=# rel="noskim noopener nofollow sponsored" data-retailer-type=AMAZON data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" data-amazon-asin=B01J248CRM id=product-record__image_1-0-7 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bio Ionic Stylewinder Rotating Styling Iron" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/EX8hKVnHQX8Y7j3zWu_8Jush6fg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bio-ionic-stylewinder-rotating-styling-iron-90936fb2388c4abfa5e5f8cd3ab953e3.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Clamp Tension</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As someone with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>fine, flat hair,</a> I know firsthand the struggle of attaining bouncy, well-defined curls. Luckily, this rotating curler has changed the game. It has a one-inch iron barrel that easily wraps around thin hair in seconds. The barrel is the ideal size for achieving voluminous curls that are not too loose or too tight – AKA the perfect happy medium. Additionally, it’s made from iron, which helps reduce frizz while also adding moisture to strands. (I’ve noticed that my hair is much shinier when I use this tool as opposed to others.)&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">I also really enjoy the large clamp that this tool has. It securely holds my thin hair in place while it rotates, and it doesn’t leave crimps or bumps. Another underrated feature: It has a nine-foot swivel cord that makes maneuvering this curler around your head a breeze.&nbsp; While this isn’t a huge deal, it takes about three minutes for the iron to fully heat up, which is much longer than the other tools we tested.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Barrel Size: </strong>1 inch<strong> </strong>|<strong> Heat Settings: </strong>440 degrees<strong> </strong>|<strong> Barrel Material: </strong>Iron | <strong>Speeds: </strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-thick-hair-lyealion-interchangeable-hair-curling-wand></span> <a href=# rel="noskim noopener nofollow sponsored" data-retailer-type=AMAZON data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" data-amazon-asin=B097C1YFM5 id=product-record__image_1-0-8 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lyealion Interchangeable Hair Curling Wand" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/fVjEsOO7EHr5TCK7rtfXRfn8N8M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Lyealion-Interchangeable-Hair-Curling-Wand-63adc30f10a1476a981098f3d8f7f256.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Clamp Tension</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have thick hair and are looking to experiment with different curl sizes, this hot tool will give you all the freedom and flexibility you want. It comes with three barrel heads (complete with barrel sizes that are ¾ -inch, 1-inch, and 1 ¼-inch wide) that are easy to change between. These varying barrels can create a range of curls, including big, beachy waves, soft curls, light waves, and tight ringlets. Beyond the interchangeable barrels, another cool feature ensures you achieve the style you want: The iron beeps when each ringlet is ready to be released, guaranteeing even heat distribution and preventing damage.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for the best part? This product comes with a wide-tooth comb, a heat-resistant glove, three hair clips, 24 small claw clips, and a box to store everything in, so you have everything you need when you’re ready to style. Honestly, the only thing we’d change is the placement of the curling buttons in relation to the release button — they’re very close to each other and can be mistaken for each other. As you get to know the device this will be less likely to happen, but it takes some getting used to.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Barrel Sizes: </strong>¾ -inch, 1 inch, 1 ¼-inch |<strong> Heat Settings: </strong>450 degrees<strong> </strong>|<strong> Barrel Material: </strong>Ceramic | <strong>Speeds: </strong>1</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jessica Juliao</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-air-technology-dyson-airwrap-multi-styler-complete-long></span> <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow sponsored noskim" data-retailer-type=SKIMLINKS data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" id=product-record__image_1-0-9 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dyson Airwrap Multi-Styler Complete Long" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/f67CWzuqtj1VgKG0MSvveHfIJ0c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/airwrap-multistyler-complete-long-dyson-2bc69a951bec42a992d8e7b3a4d3fee2.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We couldn’t have a list of the best rotating curling irons without this innovative device. Compared to other tools on our list, this one uses very little heat to curl hair, which means your strands are at less risk of being exposed to heat damage. (This ultimately means less breakage, frizz, and dryness.)&nbsp;Despite the lack of heat, curls maintain shape because Dyson uses what’s called the Coanda Effect. This so-called ‘effect’ is essentially an aerodynamic phenomenon where the tool is able to create a spinning vortex of air that allows hair to easily wrap around it. From there, a beautiful curl is created.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The device ultimately comes with six attachments, but two specifically to curl hair. “The larger barrel results in loose/wavy curls similar to a blowout, while the smaller barrel results in more bounce and wavy curls,” explains InStyle tester Stacey. Once she got the hang of using the Airwrap, Stacey says styling was a breeze, but she did experience a bit of a learning curve. “It was hard to identify the settings once the tool was wrapped in my hair, but I think if you owned the tool and had more practice this would be easier to navigate.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Barrel Sizes: </strong>1.2 inches, 1.6 inches<strong> </strong>|<strong> Heat Settings: </strong>194 degrees<strong> </strong>|<strong> Barrel Material:</strong> Plastic composite | <strong>Speeds: </strong>N/A</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jessica Juliao</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cordless-conair-unbound-rechargeable-cordless-auto-curler-curling-iron></span> <a href=# rel="noskim noopener nofollow sponsored" data-retailer-type=AMAZON data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" data-amazon-asin=B07XBZDFNK id=product-record__image_1-0-10 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Conair Unbound Rechargeable Cordless Auto-Curler Curling Iron" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/TMOpJod4sax3seU2Lv1n6cKzopY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/conair-unbound-cordless-auto-curler-e58347031f4c44faa3d8e9e41e924159.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>2.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Clamp Tension</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>1</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Conair Unbound Cordless is small, lightweight, and portable, which means you can curl your hair from literally anywhere. Just charge the device before you use it (it comes with a charging cord), and then you have one hour to curl all the hair you want.&nbsp; To use, simply insert a section of hair into the chamber, press the ‘on’ button, and watch as it magically styles your strands into “perfect ringlets,” according to InStyle tester Samantha. (Once your hair is ready to be released, you’ll hear two beeps.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, you can customize the heat settings – there are four different settings that range from 300 to 400 degrees – as well as the amount of time you want your hair to curl. As a bonus, you can also select which direction you want your curl to go in. We will say that it curls pieces pretty tightly, and can sometimes tug at the hair, but Samantha says this sensation isn't painful. Overall, we find that this device is easy and fast, and it creates long-lasting curls.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Barrel Size: </strong>1 inch<strong> </strong>|<strong> Heat Settings: </strong>400 degrees<strong> </strong>|<strong> Barrel Material: </strong>Ceramic | <strong>Speeds: </strong>1</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jessica Juliao</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-manual-rotating-curling-iron-amika-the-autopilot-3-in-1-rotating-curling-iron></span> <a href=# rel="noskim noopener nofollow sponsored" data-retailer-type=AMAZON data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" data-amazon-asin=B07XB2FKZJ id=product-record__image_1-0-11 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amika The Autopilot 3-in-1 Rotating Curling Iron" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2gYHnouDfOErABNUxrHtnFrL1IY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/amika-the-autopilot-3-in-1-rotating-curling-iron-1a6afbcaa5ac4bc6815a6643ba70754e.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Clamp Tension</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">OK, so this Amika hair tool is a bit different from the rest. “This curling iron isn't actually an automatic curling iron,” explains InStyle tester Nasya. “It can rotate in either direction, but I had to manually curl my hair around the wand.” What this means is that this tool can rotate, but it doesn’t actually rotate hair with it, like the other devices. Because of this, this device is ideal for anyone who wants to test out a curler that’s a bit more advanced than a normal wand. It has two settings: Locked, which makes it act like a normal curling iron, and unlocked, which allows the iron to rotate on an axis.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from the tool’s rotating abilities, this iron also has other impressive features, including its 1.2-inch ceramic barrel that helps to reduce frizz and add shine. Additionally, it has a nine-foot swivel cord, as well as a feature that shuts it down after one hour of use. We will note that this tool only has one button, though. “It has an on/off button that also serves as the toggle button to increase or lower the temperatures,” explains Nasya. Because of this, be sure you do not accidentally press the button when you are curling hair since this can cause the device to turn off.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Barrel Size: </strong>1.2 inches |<strong> Heat Settings: </strong>450 degrees<strong> </strong>|<strong> Barrel Material: </strong>Ceramic | <strong>Speeds: </strong>N/A</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jessica Juliao</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind<br></span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Barrel Size: </strong>Depending on your hair type and length, you should find a barrel size to meet your needs. “If you have shorter hair or want a tighter curl, you will benefit the most from using a barrel that is one inch or less,” says Williams. “Anyone with long hair or who prefers a loose curl, should go for a larger barrel that's 1.25 inches and up.” Ultimately though, the barrel size you choose depends on the type of curl you want. “The general rule of thumb is that narrow barrels produce very tight, bouncy, spirally, and compact curls; and the opposite is also true. Wider barrels give long and loose curls,” explains hairstylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Viktor Holas</a>. If you want to create a combination of curl styles, opt for a tool with interchangeable barrels.</li><li><strong>Heat Settings:</strong> “Before choosing a heat setting on a rotating curling iron, the user must first consider their strand volume, length, and most importantly, hair type,” says Holas. “That way, they are less likely to accidentally damage the hair or get sub-optimal curls.” Once you know your hair type (whether it’s straight, wavy, curly, or coily) as well as your hair texture (whether it’s fine, medium, or thick), you can determine what temperature you should use your curling iron. “For thin, weak, and fragile hair, the ideal heat setting should be between 200 and 300 degrees. Then, for medium, soft, and normal hair, any temperature between 300 and 380 degrees often gets the job done. Temperatures above 380 to around 450 degrees are ideal for very stubborn hair types (i.e. tough, strong, and wiry),” explains Holas. “To be safe, I (and most hairstylists, in general) always start from the bottom end of the temperature range, and work my way up until I reach the optimal curling temperature for the client's specific hair type.” Additionally, use a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>heat protectant</a> any time you use a hot tool.</li><li><strong>How It Rotates: </strong>Generally, there are three different ways rotating curling irons can curl hair. First, there are tools that curl hair at the press of a button (a good majority of the rotating curl irons on this list curl hair in this way. These buttons can usually curl hair towards and away from the face. On the other hand, some rotating curling irons can curl hair with the help of air technology. These tools utilize high-speed airflow to attract the hair to the barrel. From there, this warm air is able to create a curl.&nbsp;Finally, some rotating curling irons rotate based on the flick of the user’s wrist. These kinds of tools are great because they ensure you don't accidentally press the wrong button and end up curling your hair in the wrong direction.&nbsp;</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered<br></span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you use a rotating curling iron?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Regardless of how a rotating curling iron operates — whether it be with the push of a button, a flick of your wrist, or with air-flow technology, the process is relatively simple, says celebrity beauty strategist and connector <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Nina Vargas</a>. For the classic button-operated iron, “prep your hair as normal, place your first section of hair so that the ends are in the clamp, and click the button,” she explains. "At this point, the barrel will begin rotating, wrapping the strand around the barrel and curling your hair with ease. This will not only speed up the curling process and save you from an extra arm workout, but it also makes it easier to achieve uniform, precise curls for that perfect, fresh-from-the-salon look.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For the tools that use airflow technology simply place your hair near the barrel and the airflow will wrap the strand around on its own, creating a bouncy curl in seconds, sans clamp.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do rotating curl irons work?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Rotating curling irons are similar to curling irons and straighteners in the sense that they style hair by using heated plates. However, they are different due to the way the barrel works. “Design-wise, [a rotating curling iron] features a cylindrical plate or barrel that spins automatically,” says Holas. Additionally, most rotating curling irons feature clamps that are able to securely hold the hair while the barrel rotates.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are rotating curling irons safe?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Yes, they are safe,” says Holas. “ Although, I always advise caution when dealing with heat-based styling tools. It's important to take the necessary steps to ensure you don't get burns or damage your hair unintentionally. To ensure this, always use a suitable heat protectant spray on your hair, wear heat-resistant gloves, and try not to get too close to your skin. And remember, start from lower temperatures and work your way up until you hit the perfect heating level.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us<br></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Lauren Harano</a> has over seven years of experience in the beauty industry, previously holding editorial positions at Cosmopolitan, Seventeen, POPSUGAR, and NBCUniversal; and writing beauty pieces for InStyle since August 2022.
