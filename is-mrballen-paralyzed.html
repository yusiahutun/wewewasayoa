amongst the social media platform’s true crime influencers.</p><p>He’s got a hunger for all things dark and mysterious, and fans have a hunger for all things related to MrBallen.</p><p>It’s not all about his stories, either.</p><p>Fans want to know what he did as a Navy SEAL.</p><p>They want to know why he retired.</p><p>They want to know where he’s from, what he does outside of telling creepy stories, and they want to know how he’s coped with his experiences.</p><p>Many even ask the question: is MrBallen paralyzed?</p><p>Here are all the answers you need.</p><img fetchpriority=high

from?</strong></h2><p>Jonathan Allen grew up just outside of Boston in a place called Quincy, Massachusetts.</p><p>He’s got two sisters, his mom is a freelance writer, and his dad is a journalist.</p><p>Allen says that while his dad’s knowledge has helped him to value research, he hadn’t been interested in storytelling as a kid.</p><p>Having two experienced writers in the family definitely set Allen up for success.</p><p>He was accepted into the University of Massachusetts in Amherst—mainly, he admits, because his mother helped him write his essays.</p><p>MrBallen was a pretty average student in high school, and then again in college—he dropped out after one semester.</p><p>He tried again, though, completing three semesters in Boston while living in his mom’s basement.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-72441 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/is-john-b-allen-in-a-wheelchair.jpg.webp

style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-72441 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><h2><strong>How did MrBallen become a Navy SEAL?</strong></h2><p>At a loss for what to do after he left college, Jonathan considered joining the military.</p><p>His mother, eager to help him find his path when he was floundering, got him in touch with some family friends—both of whom were Navy SEALs.</p><p>In December of 2010, he headed off to boot camp and began training to become a SEAL.</p><p>Allen describes his time with the military as “intense,” and while he enjoyed the camaraderie and brotherhood, and the opportunities he was afforded as a Navy SEAL, it wasn’t all as easy as people might think.</p><p>Especially after he was deployed to Afghanistan in 2014.</p><h2><strong>Why did MrBallen retire from the military?</strong></h2><p><br>While he was in Afghanistan, Allen’s platoon was caught up in a firefight.</p><p>At one point, a grenade ricocheted off his shoulder and exploded, sending damaging shrapnel into Allen’s lower body.</p><p>Talking about that time in an interview some years later, Jonathan explained that:</p><p>“I went deaf and blind and thought I was going to die.”</p><p>Allen was losing too much blood, but the quick reaction of his unit’s medic ultimately saved his life.</p><p>A helicopter airlifted him out of the combat zone.</p><p>Within weeks, Jonathan was back Stateside to make a recovery—but the close brush with death made him re-evaluate what mattered.</p><p>As he had laid there bleeding out in Afghanistan, Jonathan’s biggest regret had been not starting a family with his wife.</p><p>This, he decided, was his priority.</p><p>At the end of his military contract, Allen was medically retired from the Navy.</p><h2><strong>How did MrBallen cope with his experiences?</strong></h2><p>It wasn’t easy, according to the honest and transparent former military man.</p><p>He panicked—as many retired service people do—about what he would do next.</p><p>Fortunately, Allen had the support of his wife and family, and a plan.</p><p>He founded Elite Meet with a group of special ops veterans, to support others like him in finding employment.</p><p>He also worked alongside Operators Association, a not-for-profit organization that helps coach aspiring Navy Seals and special ops trainees through training.</p><h2><strong>Is MrBallen paralyzed?</strong></h2><p>So, fans are wondering if MrBallen is paralyzed.</p><p>No.</p><p>Check him out on <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>, he has made a full recovery after his ordeal in Afghanistan.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Why did Graham leave MasterChef</a>?</p><h2><strong>How did he get famous?</strong></h2><p><br>In a nutshell: he told creepy stories.</p><p>In 2020, the retired SEAL posted a video to his TikTok account about the Dyatlov Pass incident in the late 1950s.</p><p>The incident, which involved the deaths of nine hikers, fascinated Allen.</p><p>He posted his story, took off to a water park for a day with the family, and when he checked his phone next, he “thought there was a glitch” with his phone.</p><p>His video had 5 million views.</p><p>Johnathan has the kind of storytelling charisma and expert delivery that makes viewers engage.</p><p>It’s not just the stories—because there are countless people telling the same stories about haunted houses and gory crimes.</p><p>And it’s not a shock factor, either—Allen rarely relies on graphics.</p><p>The genius of his method is in his simplicity, his authenticity, and his production value.</p><p>He’s also hungry for details and spares none in the pursuit of giving his fans the whole story.</p><p>As many fans say, listening to MrBallen is like listening to a buddy who just happens to be really good at spinning a good story.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong></h2><p style=text-align:center><a href=#>What is
