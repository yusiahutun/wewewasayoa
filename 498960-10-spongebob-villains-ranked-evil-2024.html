His sole job and purpose on SpongeBob are killing SpongeBob. However, he is willing and capable of hurting those getting in his way and never stops to consider his actions. In the film, he is recognized as one of the worst villains when Plankton hires him to kill Mr Krabs.</p><p class=align-left>He embodies a mean guy, as seen in his skull belt buckle and knife necklace. His overall tough appearance means that he is unstoppable. In addition, he just can’t seem to die. For instance, when Cyclops steps on him and temporarily tries to squish him, he doesn't die but remains stuck in Cyclops' shoes.
