It ain't gonna affect me one bit. I didn't leave the show," he began.

I can't even bend that far down to show you how much," added Frank. "That's fine. It's like you've got Aerosmith and there's Steven Tyler and he's the front man. I found my spot, I'm second and he's number one on the show. That's no problem with me, maybe he does have a problem."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Read more</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Who is Mark Harmon's wife Pam Dawber and who does she play on NCIS?" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/30b58101c7b8-ncis-pam-dawber-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Who is Mark Harmon's wife Pam Dawber and who does she play on NCIS?" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Who is Mark Harmon's wife Pam Dawber and who does she play on NCIS?</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="‘Genuinely amazing’: viewers saying same thing about gripping new sci-fi drama Fallout" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/0d0c99897456-fallouts1ut221201whijoj00058rc-e3000.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="‘Genuinely amazing’: viewers saying same thing about gripping new sci-fi drama Fallout" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>‘Genuinely amazing’: viewers saying same thing about gripping new sci-fi drama Fallout</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Baby Reindeer star Richard Gadd reveals family's reaction to real-life stalker drama" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/402b8adf5215-richard-gadd-baby-reindeer.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Baby Reindeer star Richard Gadd reveals family's reaction to real-life stalker drama" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Baby Reindeer star Richard Gadd reveals family's reaction to real-life stalker drama</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eNRzW5ncD1P data-wc=53>Reflecting on Mike's Instagram statement a month later, Frank even told that he doubted the 59-year-old had penned it.

Unless he was cutting somebody else down and we were both laughing."</p><p id=eu9xOdlj3Gc data-wc=21>Mike eventually responded to Frank's comments, suggesting that the star's struggles with alcohol addiction had played a part in their feud.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5a238f6a84df-frank-fritz-mike-wolfe-red-carpet.jpg><p id=eVPcWKz6ZfX data-wc=62>"We all do care about Frank and we want him back on the show.

There has been lots of opinions in regards to mine and Frank's friendship and the show but now is not the time to set the record straight. Now is the time to pray for my friend," he began.</p><p id=eszan8kkvpz data-wc=35>"Frank has suffered a stroke and is in the hospital. Please keep him in your hearts and thoughts.
