Edebiri – who won the award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy TV series for her role in The Bear – took her moment on stage to give a shout out to that most underrated, undervalued cog in the machine: the assistant.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As a former assistant myself, I not only appreciated but totally understood what Edebiri meant when she thanked "all of my agents' and managers' assistants," adding: "Y'all are real ones. Thank you for answering my crazy, crazy emails." Even Taylor Swift could be seen applauding in the audience, and seemingly say "yup!" in agreement with Edebiri's words.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for 10 Best Dressed from the Golden Globes 2024" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/hbz-velocity-ggs-24-thumbnail-659bbf2412b5f.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's not entirely surprising that Edebiri, a frequent face on the picket lines during last year's <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a44687421/hollywood-strikes-explainer/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes</a>, chose to speak up for behind-the-scenes Hollywood crew members, but it's still unusual – normally, assistants don't get much air-time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It might have been very far from LA, but my first assistant role – my first full-time job, in fact – was actually imbued with a little reflected glamour. I was the second assistant (back then, important figures often had more than one) to a very stylish and revered literary agent, who would wear sky-high heels to the office every day and whizz around town on the back of a motorbike.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My job was simple (or so it seemed): to book tables and taxis, and deal with the day-to-day running of her life. In fact, it was one of the most complicated jobs I've ever done, and encompassed everything from hairdressers screaming at me in German (never try to change a blow-dry appointment on the eve of the Frankfurt Book Fair) to late-night trips to Fortnum & Mason in December, the doors of which were kept open for me so that I could buy some crackers for my boss' last-minute Christmas dinner.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"My assistant jobs were the hardest I've ever worked, and also mark some of my proudest moments"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I learnt so much in this role that, when I decided to switch careers and become a journalist, I was thrilled to be taken on as an assistant by a much-admired (and, honestly, much-feared) editor. She was famous for her Miranda Priestly-esque tendencies and, to this day, it's still the job people ask me about most. However, though there were plenty of film-worthy moments (the driver at Paris Fashion Week getting arrested springs to mind) it was the biggest learning curve I've had to date.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In that magazine job, I watched my boss conduct meetings, take phone calls, hire and fire. She could be utterly terrifying, yes, but to me she was always fair and encouraging. These days, I generally run my working life according to what she taught me: for example, I never go to a meeting without a notebook, and I always try to spotlight and hero the work of other women, something about which she was particularly passionate. Whenever I'm late for a meeting, I can hear her chiding me in my head; likewise, if I ever err on the wrong side of casual dress for work.</p><img alt="editorial use only no book cover usagemandatory credit photo by moviestoreshutterstock 1647474athe devil wears prada, meryl streep, anne hathawayfilm and television" title="Film and Television" width=3072 height=2034 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/shutterstock-editorial-1647474a-659c1a7b80629.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Moviestore/Shutterstock</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Shutterstock</span><p>The Devil Wears Prada gave an insight into the impossible lives of fashion assistants</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Assistants are so often the beating heart of an office, responsible for booking travel, inputting expenses, making tea and, yes, replying to a fair few "crazy, crazy emails". And yet, so often their contributions go overlooked – a fact that's particularly galling given that executive and personal assistant roles are filled by women <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://epaa.org.uk/campaigns-policy-research/not-just-girls-job/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="94 per cent" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">94 per cent</a> of the time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My assistant jobs were some of the hardest I've ever worked, and also mark some of the moments I'm proudest of in my career to date. Being at the bottom of the ladder taught me how to get on with everyone, how to be organised and, most importantly, how to graft hard to get where you want to be.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I keep in touch with both the wonderful women for whom I was an assistant, and I consider it a great testament to our working relationships that we keep up with each others' careers. I'll always remember them both for giving me the large majority of my 'big breaks' – although I won't necessarily miss making quite so many cups of tea.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr9Slq66qlWSwtrjTrqmeZZ6axLR7wG1tbGllbH56e8CsqqKrpJa7tb%2BMnaZmppWasW7Ax5qlpKGenHw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fassistants-do-need-thanking.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fassistants-do-need-thanking.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fassistants-do-need-thanking.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fassistants-do-need-thanking.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fassistants-do-need-thanking.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fassistants-do-need-thanking.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./carrie-underwood-out-of-that-truck.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./carrie-underwood-out-of-that-truck.html>Carrie Underwood Leaves Her Mark in 'Out of That Truck'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./cacao-hot-chocolate-recipe.html>A Cacao Hot Chocolate Recipe for Energy and Positivity</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./cacao-hot-chocolate-recipe.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
