<time>23 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p></p><p>CHARLES TOWN, WV (CelebrityAccess) – In the whirlwind of <strong>Staind</strong> frontman & singer/songwriter <a href=#><strong><u>Aaron Lewis’s</u></strong></a> busy life, I found myself sitting at the Hollywood Casino and Racetrack for his acoustic show and follow-up interview&nbsp; – a continuation and update from our <span><a href=#><span><strong>first chat</strong></span></a> </span>in April 2023 and once again being caught in a conversation that offered a glimpse into the mind of a seasoned performer and musician.</p><p>Our talk began by discussing his upcoming gigs, another 2024 hugging the road – with some makeup shows sprinkled into the mix. The funny part? He wasn’t entirely sure about the official name of his 2024 solo tour. That night, his show was billed as “The Acoustic Tour.” It got me thinking – managing a career with so many moving parts seems like a wild ride, but Aaron keeps it interesting – focusing on the music and making his journey one <span>hell</span> of a show.</p><p>The spotlight shifted to his upcoming acoustic album, <strong><span>The Hill</span></strong>, via <span><a href=#><span>Big Machine Label Group’s</span></a></span> <strong>Valory Music Co.</strong>, slated for release on March 29th. You can pre-order the album <span><a href=#><span>HERE</span></a></span>. A compilation of ten tracks, penned solo or with a tight group of friends and confidants, the tracks speak to a time of upheaval both within yourself and in the wider world. Following in the acoustic manner that was his 2022 collection, Frayed At Both Ends, the lyrics are what make the most impact, and Aaron is a true lyricist who can pack a punch to the gut with a single line.</p><p>Produced by Aaron alongside <strong>Ira Dean</strong>, <strong><span>The Hill</span></strong> is raw in the purest sense of the Country-rock term – often backing his jagged and iconic vocal rasp with just a guitar, dobro, and mandolin. Plus, the album had been ready for quite some time. Collaboration priorities with Staind’s 2023 full-length release, Confessions of the Fallen, and the band hitting the road in 2023 imposed some constraints, adding to the anticipation of the solo album’s March release date.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrityaccess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Aaron_lewis_thehill-300x300.jpg><p>Inquiring about the origin of the album’s title, Aaron revealed was a collaborative effort between himself and <strong>Ben [Kitterman, Aaron’s manager]</strong>. The creative process, as Aaron describes it, involved a “spontaneous exchange of ideas, with titles emerging from the rhythm of their brainstorming sessions.”</p><p>In speaking of <span><strong>The Hill’s</strong></span> creation process, Aaron unveiled that it was recorded during breaks between Staind’s commitments/touring and his solo trek this past year, with some of the songs written even before. He shed light on collaborations with familiar names like <strong><span>Dan Tyminski</span></strong>, who appeared on Frayed at Both Ends&nbsp;and <strong><span>Jeffrey Steele</span></strong>. He then revealed his preference for a “raw and less-produced” sound, emphasizing that he has always been a proponent of “less is more.” He shared his aversion to relying on backing tracks during live performances, saying, “It’s always been about the song.”</p><p>In a press release for the new album, Aaron says,</p><p><span><strong>Music has always been my escape, my way of expressing the things that I don’t express very well in life. I’m coming up on 52 years old, and I’m on the hill I’m going to stand on. Nobody’s going to change me now. This record is a snapshot of my life, how I’m feeling, and where my head is at – and that’s what my records have always been. It’s another record that’s just really stripped down to the guts. I like raw. I like life’s imperfections showing through. I’m not perfect; nobody is. And I don’t want the music I’m putting out to be either.</strong></span></p><p>In exploring the choice of the first single, <span><strong>“Let’s Go Fishing,”</strong></span> which was released today (January 12) – listen to it <a href=#><u>HERE</u></a>. An upbeat and catchy track that, per the press release, is “very much not about going fishing,” It brings to light the nation’s problems – but deciding to leave them for another day. Co-written with <span><strong>Bobby Pinson</strong></span>, a mix of fed-up frustration and organic country comfort creates an intriguing contrast – a light protest anthem with a let-it-be theme. “I find the whole thing tongue-in-cheek,” Aaron admits.</p><p>Known for his patriotic personal beliefs, Aaron emphasized the need for impactful music within a pivotal and sensitive political year. However, Aaron said that he and his team based the song selection as the first single on the positive and enthusiastic crowd responses at previous shows. The discussion unfolded, dissecting the lyrics and capturing Aaron’s unapologetic style. Wrapping up on a note of resolve, “AFL,” as he’s known affectionately by fans, continues to navigate the unpredictable waters of his personal convictions, his fan base, and the ever-changing political landscape.</p><br><p><strong><span>Somebody’s got to live this shit, and these songs, they’re me,” he says. “I really don’t feel like I’m alone in my feelings – I’m just more willing to open up my mouth.</span></strong></p><p>During the interview, attention shifted to addressing the buzz and perceived controversy around his patriotic tunes. Aaron, ever genuine, admitted that while his solo repertoire has a “patriotic flavor,” the upcoming album offered a more diverse range of songs.</p><p>So, amidst the conversational whirlwind, we delve into the heart of <strong><span>The Hill</span></strong>, where Aaron offers a glimpse into the title track of the same name. A song that transcends the patriotic theme that often characterizes his solo work. A self-aware retrospective, he shared a poignant lyric that encapsulates the song’s essence: <strong>“I’ve lived, and I’ve learned; I’ve crashed, and I’ve burned every bridge that’s tried to cross me.”</strong> The song speaks of growing older and looking back. – a man who chooses the hill where he’ll make his stand. Another line in the song, <strong>“Long climb with the can’t undo view,”</strong> speaks volumes. This introspective line gives a small glimpse inside Aaron’s life lessons, which resonate with his personal experiences. You can listen to a snippet via Aaron’s official website <a href=#><span>HERE</span></a>.</p><p>Aaron then opened up about the emotional weight of his songs., acknowledging that the writing method is only the first half of his artistic process. He disclosed the toll certain songs take on him. Showcasing not an often-seen vulnerability, he admitted to being moved to tears by at least one song on every album, inclusive of <strong><span>The Hill</span></strong>, a powerful testament to the raw verity embedded in his music. The North Country native is unfiltered in a way that leaves no room for doubt. A deeply personal set written from a lifetime of highs and lows, it pairs Aaron’s well-known vocal tenor with a bare-bones acoustic sound, a reflective mindset, and little else.</p><p>The conversation takes an unexpected turn into the realm of journalism and media dynamics, with Aaron expressing frustration with the current state of journalism, where sensationalism and clickbait often overshadow genuine conversations or “old-fashioned” journalism. Reminiscing of a bygone era, he likens the artist-journalist relationship to the days of <span><strong>Frank Sinatra</strong>,</span> which underscores what this writer believes is his desire for <span>genuine</span> engagement.</p><p>Because we were off topic for a moment, it was no surprise that amid an interview that was supposed to be all about music, Aaron veered off into the deep waters of a discussion about fish bait. With the same fervor he reserves for his music, he recounted tales of past fishing mishaps, using baits with names that sounded more like secret code words than fishing gear. I wondered if I had stumbled into an impromptu fishing podcast rather than a music interview – as he showcased handmade fish baits & engaged in a lighthearted exchange with me about fishing experiences (him having many and me having one).</p><p>As the conversation shifted back to its course, it pivoted towards another specific song on <strong><span>The Hill,</span></strong> a tune he has played live titled <span><strong>“Made in China.”</strong></span> As Aaron unravels the genesis of the song, it becomes apparent that the inspiration stems from a simple yet impactful moment during a studio session.</p><p>Aaron spoke of the moment of revelation when he picked up various items around the studio (cup, stapler, etc.), each with the stamp <span>“Made in China.”</span> The repetition of this discovery sparked a realization that found its way into his lyrics. The chorus’s declaration, “I ain’t made in China,” becomes an assertion of his pride in being from the United States, with him pointing out that his body is tattooed with the words “Proudly Made in the <span>U</span><span>S</span><span>A</span>.”</p><p>However, as with many of Aaron’s songs, there’s more beneath the surface. Aaron spoke about the potential controversies that may arise upon the song’s release, and it captured a snapshot of who Aaron is. An artist who is unafraid to confront potential misinterpretations while providing context and a little insight into the layers of his creative process. Aaron responded with clarity, emphasizing that the song’s intent was never to make a statement about human beings but rather a reflection on American manufacturing.&nbsp; The conversation widens to touch upon the dual nature of other songs in his catalog, exemplified by <span><strong>“Life Behind Bars”</strong></span> (Frayed At Both Ends), which isn’t about a prison cell – but a metaphorical set of bars put into place by your own mind.</p><p>As he shared snippets of the songs from the new album, <strong><span>“That’s My Life”</span></strong> stood out as this writer’s personal favorite. His voice, filled with emotion, carried a raw and raspy quality. The lyrics touch on the idea of staying within one’s own boundaries and, with interpretation, refraining from passing judgment on those around us.&nbsp;It appears Aaron advocates for individual pursuits with the line, “<span><strong>You do yours, and I’ll do mine,</strong></span>” a sentiment that resonated deeply with me as a writer. In a world quick to highlight controversy, where online trolls can be unkind, the song’s message about focusing on our own lives struck a chord. If everyone tended to their own yards, life would be a more harmonious space.</p><p>Discussing the songs in his catalog, Aaron emphasized the importance of keeping things “fresh.” This means that the songs he performs night after night do not become stale, tiresome, or boring. He emphasized the reciprocal relationship between him and the fans. The energy and enjoyment of the audience serve as a catalyst, and why he never tires of even the most well-worn tracks, such as fan-favorites <span><strong>“Am I the Only One”</strong></span> and the Staind song<strong><span> “It’s Been Awhile.”</span></strong> He touched on the challenge of performing emotionally charged songs night after night and how compartmentalization becomes a crucial skill, allowing him to put aside the emotional gut feeling of each song and deliver them with the necessary depth during live shows.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrityaccess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/aaronwalk1-1-300x271.jpg alt width=246 height=222 sizes="(max-width: 246px) 100vw, 246px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>He spoke of his recent vocal challenges, during which he openly discussed the reasons behind his temporary vocal rest and the necessity for a break at the end of 2023. The relentless demands of a rigorous touring schedule, amplified by the strain of extensive performances, particularly with Staind shows where he unleashes his inner vocal “beast” a lot more than his solo outings, took a toll on his vocal cords – necessitating a period of time off from the road. Consequently, Aaron had to cancel most of his scheduled shows in December 2023. The good news is that all those shows have been rescheduled; he has returned to prime vocal condition and is back in fighting shape – hitting the road once again.</p><p>Touching on his setlist for the upcoming tour, Aaron hinted at the possibility of going back to a format where each night’s show is different. 2024 will be another banner year for the “Road Dog” with new solo music, a solo tour, and confirmation of plans for Staind-related activities, including a tour in the coming year with <strong>Saint Asonia, Seether,</strong> and<strong> Tim Montana.</strong></p><p>Wrapping up, the feeling hit me – Aaron is like that cool, slightly battered guitar in the corner of a musician’s studio. You know, the one that’s been through some gigs – has seen a lot of things, and every strum can tell a story. He’s been through some shit, but <strong>damn, he still knows how to play.</strong> Having weathered the storms, he still wields his craft with incredible finesse while chain-smoking on a barstool. There’s laughter in his eyes and a nonchalant shrug that seems to convey, “Yeah, I’ve got a few battle scars, but who hasn’t?”</p><p>Aaron pours not just his talent but all he has into what he creates. His voice isn’t just a sound; it’s an emotion that can echo the ache within. He takes the messy parts of life, the parts no one talks about, the thoughts and feelings brought on by trauma or just living life in general, and turns them into melodies that strike a chord and hit you right in the feels. He’s not pretending everything’s perfect – and that’s what makes his music so damn <strong><span>real.</span></strong></p><p>Aaron finds strength, a reflection of a musician who, despite the cracks, stands tall in the middle of his own melodic wreckage, finding solace and, yes, beauty in music that rises from the fractures, memories, and gifts of life.</p><h4><span><strong>Fishing
