But thanks to this, he met the love of his life, Sheila, online through a Facebook group for deaf singles.</span></p><p><span>Get to know this hopeful romantic better as this David Dangerfield Bio proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>David Dangerfield On 90 Day Fiance: Before The 90 Days</b></h3><p><span>David Dangerfield was the first deaf man to be featured on</span><i><span> 90 Day Fiance: Before The 90 Days</span></i><span>. The show saw him pursue Sheila, a single mother from Cebu, Philippines, who is also completely deaf. However, unlike David, Sheila was born hearing but began using hearing aids after she had “problems with her ears” at age six.</span></p><p><span>These lovebirds first met online through a Facebook group for deaf singles. However, as David mainly communicated in the American sign language, which Sheila was not well-versed in, the couple found it hard to communicate over video calls. Thus, they worked around this by talking only through texts in English.</span></p><p><span>Now, this may cause a major issue as their meet face to face. But then again, Sheila was trying her best to learn ASL, as they say, learning sign language is a cup of tea for hearing-impaired people. And with over 2 years to their name, Sheila might have already got the hang of it.</span></p><p><span>Prior to Sheila, David had been in a couple of relationships, the last of which ended due to infidelity. “Six years ago I fell in love with a deaf woman,” he explained. “I felt so much better not being alone. But we broke up because she cheated on me. It broke my heart.”</span></p><p><span>The woman who cheated on David was named Ashley Labs. He caught her red-handed with another man (who was hidden in her closet).</span></p><p><span>Reports had that David and Ashley were engaged since December 2009</span></p><h3><b>Are David Dangerfield And Sheila Still Together?</b></h3><p><span>David Dangerfield and Sheila kept their relationship status hidden as </span><i><span>90 Day Fiance</span></i><span> was still on-air. But if you ask us, their unique relationship makes us believe they will be the couple least susceptible to drama and altercations.</span></p><p><span>Besides the ASL problem, their only concern was if Sheila’s son would connect with David or not.&nbsp; Since David cannot speak and does not understand anything other than American Sign Language, it definitely was a challenge to communicate with him.</span></p><p><span>“What if my son cannot connect with David because he is deaf?” Sheila signed in the trailer.</span></p><p><span>But where there’s a will, there’s a way. David was already head over heels for the Philippines native.</span></p><p><span>“When I first saw Sheila’s picture, it got my heart beating. Sheila is better than any other woman I’ve dated because Sheila is a sweet person,” David said. “She is the perfect match for me. I’ll love Sheila forever.”</span></p><p><span>Also, he remarked, “I will have a new family with Sheila in the future.”</span></p><h3><b>David Dangerfield Age</b></h3><p><span>David Dangerfield was 43 years of age when he appeared on </span><i><span>90 Day Fiance: Before The 90 Days</span></i><span> in 2023. However, he was a year younger when he filmed the show.</span></p><p><span>Also, this makes him 11 years older than Sheila.</span></p><h3><b>David Dangerfield Job</b></h3><p><span>David Dangerfield worked two jobs. In a grocery store, stocking shelves, and in a casino, as a cleaner. He confessed that the latter job gave him a great view of people enjoying themselves.</span></p><p><span>Since David was sending Sheila money, it’s also clear that he was getting paid handsomely.</span></p><p><span>But Sheila never asked for money in the first year they dated. It was only after COVID hit, and she lost her job and her house was destroyed by a fire and then it was hit again by a typhoon, that she wanted David’s help.</span></p><p><span>Seeing this, obviously, David’s friends and family had concerns about Sheila and didn’t want him to send her funds. Even the bartender at a local bar who is David’s friend, said, “It’s a little worrisome that someone is sending money halfway across the world to this person that they don’t know all that well. It’s very rare that anything like that can work out.”</span></p><p><span>Now, David’s also a reality star. He made around $500 to $1,000 per episode from her time on </span><i><span>90 Day Fiance: Before The 90 Days</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>As for his education, David attended </span><i><span>Tennessee School for the Deaf</span></i><span>.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is David Dangerfield Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>By 2023, David Dangerfield garnered a net worth of under $250 thousand.</span></p><h3><b>David Dangerfield Height</b></h3><p><span>David Dangerfield stands tall at a height of above 6 feet (183 cm).</span></p><p><span>Mentioning his distinct features, David has a tattoo on his shoulder, a healthy body, and often a red nose.</span></p><h3><b>David Dangerfield Family</b></h3><p><span>David didn’t talk a lot about his family. But we do know that none of them were deaf and didn’t bother teaching David sign language at home.</span></p><p><span>Some of his known family members are — Katie Thomas, and Chris Dangerfield (married to Rebecca Peralez Dangerfield).</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>Is David Dangerfield On Instagram And Facebook?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Find David on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>david.dangerfield.1675</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Here are his Facebook accounts @</span><a href=#><span>david.dangerfield.902</span></a><span> and @</span><a href=#><span>david.dangerfield.56</span></a><span>.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>When Is David Dangerfield Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>David celebrates his birthday in May.
