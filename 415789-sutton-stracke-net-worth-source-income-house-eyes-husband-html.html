Bravo TV's initial announcement indicated that Sutton would be one of the "housewives" featured on the show. However, when the show premiered, she was only a "friend" to the "housewives". But why did Sutton get demoted?</p><p class=align-left>Her role <a id=https://people.com/tv/sutton-stracke-demoted-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">did not change</a> because she had any problem. Instead, it was about her ex-husband Christian and their children. Christian did not want their kids to appear on the show. Therefore, Sutton could not play the role. However, she understood Christian's concern and readily switched to a part-time position on the show.</p><h4>Entrepreneur</h4><p class=align-left>Sutton has diversified her sources of income. She owns a boutique called <i>The Sutton Concept</i>. It is located in West Hollywood. The boutique offers attire, artistry, furniture, and ornamental things too.

However, considering her huge closet full of couture, as is evident on <i>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</i>, some believe she is worth a lot higher. So, why is Sutton Stracke so rich?
