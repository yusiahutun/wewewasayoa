Since their marriage, they have given birth to two daughters: Emma and Paige.&nbsp;Paige was born on October 27, 2015.</span></p><p><span>Nicole Koglin is an animal lover.&nbsp;While working in Missouri, she rescued a feline (cat) she named Mo, which she brought to Wisconsin when she moved.&nbsp;In fact, Mo came into her life before she met her boyfriend and now her husband.&nbsp;She revealed she was a ‘crazy closet cat lady’ during an interview when asked about a cat stroller she had purchased.&nbsp;Nicole revealed that they recently got an Australian Shepherd dog and whenever they went for a walk with him, Mo always got jealous.&nbsp;So she ordered it for the stroller.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Body measurements</span></strong></h2><p><span>The journalist and presenter is a pretty face to look like his good looks may have, in many ways, made his career in the media easier, given that TV presenters are expected to be good looking in addition to being good at their jobs.&nbsp;However, his body measurements are not disclosed publicly.&nbsp;When they are, we will let you know.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMp6Ccp5yaeqy7xqWgp2WSnryovsCpn7JlmKrAo63NnWSfmZ2eubp5zJ6YrK2imrqmutOsZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-nicole-koglin-biography-husband-family-measurements.html&text=Who%20is%20Nicole%20Koglin%3fBiography%2c%20husband%2c%20family%2c%20measurements&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-nicole-koglin-biography-husband-family-measurements.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-nicole-koglin-biography-husband-family-measurements.html&title=Who%20is%20Nicole%20Koglin%3fBiography%2c%20husband%2c%20family%2c%20measurements" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-nicole-koglin-biography-husband-family-measurements.html&title=Who%20is%20Nicole%20Koglin%3fBiography%2c%20husband%2c%20family%2c%20measurements" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-nicole-koglin-biography-husband-family-measurements.html&title=Who%20is%20Nicole%20Koglin%3fBiography%2c%20husband%2c%20family%2c%20measurements" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-nicole-koglin-biography-husband-family-measurements.html&description=Who%20is%20Nicole%20Koglin%3fBiography%2c%20husband%2c%20family%2c%20measurements" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./pokemon-legends-arceus.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wisp Locations Pokemon Legends Arceus">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./remnant-from-the-ashes-how-to-beat-barbed-terror-how-to-earn-unstable-quills-mod.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Remnant: From the Ashes  How to Beat Barbed Terror, How to Earn Unstable Quills Mod">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
