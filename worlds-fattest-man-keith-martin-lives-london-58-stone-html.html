On top of it sit model pigs, which he used to collect.</span></p><p><span>Yesterday Mr Martin fought back tears as he told of his life-or-death battle to lose weight. ‘I’ve been told to lose weight or I won’t see 50,’ he said. ‘I’ve cut down a massive amount on what I used to eat. I’m trying to keep my calorie intake to 2,500 a day [the recommended average for men] – it was at 9,000 calories a day.’<br></span></p><p><span>Mr Martin, who is advised by an NHS nutritionist once a month, said: ‘I have four rounds of toast for breakfast, soup for lunch, or sometimes skip it, and something like plain chicken and rice for dinner.</span></p><p><span>‘I’ve given up having two sugars in coffee and have one low calorie sweetener instead. Sometimes I’ll have a couple of plain digestive biscuits. I can’t stand them, but give me a chocolate digestive and I’ll eat the packet.’</span></p><p><span>He used to order huge amounts of junk food to his house through online shopping, but now eats only what is cooked for him by his two sisters, who live with him.<br></span></p><p><span>Mr Martin is believed to have taken the fattest man title from a 90-stone Mexican called Manuel Uribe, who has gone on a diet and is now 31st 6lb.</span></p><p><span>But Mr Martin said: ‘I won’t be contacting Guinness World Records about it. It’s not something to be proud of.’</span></p><p><span>■ Big Body Squad begins on Wednesday, February 22, at 8pm on Channel 5.</span><br></p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2FcnyPaWxrZ4ekv62w0madmqykmsC1ecyapWaDlZ7BqXmsmqmtoZ5iuarCxKxkhaeembyveZRxZKysn6Oyb7TTpqM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fworlds-fattest-man-keith-martin-lives-london-58-stone-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fworlds-fattest-man-keith-martin-lives-london-58-stone-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fworlds-fattest-man-keith-martin-lives-london-58-stone-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fworlds-fattest-man-keith-martin-lives-london-58-stone-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fworlds-fattest-man-keith-martin-lives-london-58-stone-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fworlds-fattest-man-keith-martin-lives-london-58-stone-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./48-facts-about-randy-quaid.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./48-facts-about-randy-quaid.html>48 Facts About Randy Quaid</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-edward-robson-karrin-taylor-robson-husband-married-life-and-net-worth-2022.html>Who Is Edward Robson?
