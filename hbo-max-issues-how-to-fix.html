<time>09 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>There are few things more frustrating than not being able to watch HBO Max after a long, hard day. Whether it's a crashing app or endless buffering, most HBO Max issues can be fixed by following some simple steps.</p><p>We're going to list the most common HBO Max problems and tell you how to fix them.</p><h2 id=why-does-hbo-max-keep-crashing>1. Why Does HBO Max Keep Crashing?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hbo-max-problem.jpg><p>At one point or another, we've all dealt with streaming apps that crash unexpectedly. When repeatedly hitting the play button doesn't work, try the methods below to get HBO Max up and running. You can use most of these methods regardless of what device you're on.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Make sure you're using the latest version of HBO Max on your device before trying anything else. <a href=#>HBO Max is not the same as HBO Go or HBO Now</a> and updating one will not automatically update the other.</p><p>Once you've updated to the latest version, check your internet connection to see how your network is running. If a bad connection is the cause, reset your router, wait until it reconnects, then try watching HBO Max again.</p><p>If you're still experiencing issues, try clearing your device's cache. The cache can hold on to old data that may be interfering with HBO Max. Log back into the app to see if that clears up the issue.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Your last resort is to delete the HBO Max app entirely and reinstall it onto your device. This will require you to log back into your account, but could be the saving grace for getting back to your show or movie.</p><h2 id=hbo-max-app-sound-not-working>2. HBO Max App Sound Not Working</h2><p>At one time, silent movies were all we could enjoy. Nowadays, if you're watching a silent movie, chances are something has gone wrong.</p><p>When you're having trouble with your audio on HBO Max, try putting on a different show or movie first. This will help you identify if the problem is with that specific show or movie, or the entire app. If only one show is giving you problems, reach out to HBO Max using the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Feedback Forum</a>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>If the entire app isn't playing sound, check the audio levels on the media player first, then on your devices. If you're streaming from your TV or computer and have speakers plugged in, check the audio levels on those as well.</p><p>Try plugging in headphones if you're using a smartphone to see if you can hear any sound from them. Also, turn off your Bluetooth in case the sound is being sent to another device and make sure they do not disturb setting is not enabled on the phone either.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Always make sure you're running the latest version of HBO Max and if you're using a computer, make sure your browser is updated.</p><h2 id=hbo-max-won-39-t-play-buffering-issues>3. HBO Max Won't Play (Buffering Issues)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/speed-test.jpg><p>Getting stuck on an indefinite loading screen can be infuriating. These types of issues are generally caused by network bandwidth, connection speed, and available memory.</p><p>Having a low connection speed is a common reason why you might be seeing the never-ending load screen. There are several online sites you can use that will test your connection speed to see if it's within appropriate limits. Reset your router if the issue continues to persist.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Test Your Wi-Fi Speed</a></span></p><p>Another way to fix buffering issues is to get everyone else who is using your network to pause their activity. By having only one device on the network, it will allocate as much bandwidth as possible to your device.</p><p>If you're using a TV or computer, plugging in an Ethernet cord will hook you directly to the internet and give you a more reliable connection.</p><p>Finally, streaming HBO Max from a smartphone will have a better connection if you're using Wi-Fi instead of using your cellular data.</p><h2 id=hbo-max-streaming-issues-error-code-321>4. HBO Max Streaming Issues (Error Code 321)</h2><p>Although there is no official word from HBO Max about error code 321, there are still some options when attempting to troubleshoot.</p><p>First, check the internet connection to make sure everything is working fine and there are no issues with the router or network.</p><p>There could also be a service outage in your area causing the issue. If there is an outage, you'll need to wait until HBO Max fixes the problem before watching your show or movie.</p><p>Make sure you're running the most up-to-date version of HBO Max on your device. Outdated versions can be a reason for many issues, so you should always be updating when possible.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>HBO Max is not allowed in all countries yet, so if you're trying to watch from an out-of-service area you could be seeing the 321 code. Unfortunately, not even a VPN is going to get you out of this situation because those are restricted as well.</p><h2 id=hbo-max-error-code-100-and-420>5. HBO Max Error Code 100 and 420</h2><p>These two errors are common for people who are trying to watch HBO Max in a country where it isn't available, or using a VPN to try and circumvent it.</p><p>If you're running a VPN and live inside the US, turn it off and try playing your show or movie again. It doesn't matter how <a href=#>good or fast your VPN</a> is, HBO Max still has the ability to detect if you are using one. Sometimes you may have to wait several minutes before HBO Max realizes you've turned your VPN off.</p><p>Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do if you live outside the service area and want to watch HBO Max. Currently, the platform doesn't allow anyone outside the US and some of its territories to stream.</p><p>Another reason you could be seeing these error codes is that there could be a service outage, high traffic, or the server is down. These types of issues are out of your control, and you'll need to wait a while to see if they get fixed.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=streaming-on-too-many-devices>6. Streaming on Too Many Devices</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/manage-devices.jpg><p>Depending on your plan, you're only available to stream HBO Max from a specific number of devices at the same time.</p><p>To check what devices are currently watching HBO Max, select your <strong>Profile icon</strong>. Choose <strong>Manage Devices,</strong> which will pull up a list of devices that you have recently used to watch your shows or movies.</p><p>You have the option to either stop streaming on the recently used device or log out of HBO Max for all devices that you no longer require.</p><h2 id=hbo-max-won-39-t-load>7. HBO Max Won't Load</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/downdetector.jpg><p>Occasionally, the technical errors with HBO Max don't have anything to do with your device at all. It could be the servers for HBO Max are down or they aren't functioning properly.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Downdetector</a> is a site that monitors the number of problem and outage reports issued against a website or service. Search for HBO Max and it will show how many people have filed complaints for each hour of the day. It also compares against the average number of complaints made for the specific time you are checking.</p><p>If there are many reports in process, chances are the issue is on HBO's end, not yours. If that's the case, you'll need to wait until HBO fixes it. There isn't anything you can do from your end to help.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=is-hbo-max-working-again>Is HBO Max Working Again?</h2><p>Not every streaming problem is within your control. Following the troubleshooting methods above should give you a good idea of how to go about fixing the problems you do have control over.</p><p>Is HBO Max down for everyone? While you wait, be sure to check out the many other great (and free!) streaming services out there to stay entertained.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGifm6ddoq65ecisqq6do2K1sMOMraZmnpmtfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhbo-max-issues-how-to-fix.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhbo-max-issues-how-to-fix.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhbo-max-issues-how-to-fix.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhbo-max-issues-how-to-fix.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhbo-max-issues-how-to-fix.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhbo-max-issues-how-to-fix.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./iced-oatmeal-cookie-recipe.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./iced-oatmeal-cookie-recipe.html>Neurotic Baker's Iced Oatmeal Cookie Recipe</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./431217-bar-rescue-cast-crew-2021-where-today.html>Bar Rescue cast and crew in 2021: Where are they today?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./431217-bar-rescue-cast-crew-2021-where-today.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
