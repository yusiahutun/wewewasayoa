"It's a new league, you're dealing with new players, tougher opponents, you know you're not at your best because you're still trying to adapt and settle into your new life."</p><p>Stam said that he paid attention to the criticism that was hurled at him by journalists and "couldn't believe" the stick he was getting early on into his career in Manchester. "Of course I'd read what was being written about me, and the match ratings from journalists, and I was shocked at the time to see what people were saying about me," he added.</p><p><b><i>Is Jaap Stam Manchester United's greatest-ever defender?

I would say extraordinary. Extraordinary in every way. He had massive belief in me as a player by bringing me in. A player from Holland who nobody really knew... maybe a few people had seen me playing for PSV in the <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Champions League</a>. But the boss stuck with me, believed in me, and didn't just help me out as a player, but also as a person," Stam continued.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8Wopq2akaG5cLnAp5qhnaOpsrN51KegrZ2UYreirc9mqq2ZnWKxprLEp5ueql1ofnp9lnBwbw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmanchester-united-jaap-stam-defender-31917796.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmanchester-united-jaap-stam-defender-31917796.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmanchester-united-jaap-stam-defender-31917796.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmanchester-united-jaap-stam-defender-31917796.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmanchester-united-jaap-stam-defender-31917796.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmanchester-united-jaap-stam-defender-31917796.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./danny-wimmer-adam-weiser-and-austin-neal-among-the-2023-ieba-winners.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./danny-wimmer-adam-weiser-and-austin-neal-among-the-2023-ieba-winners.html>Danny Wimmer, Adam Weiser And Austin Neal Among The 2023 IEBA Winners</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tyson-james.html>Tyson James - Bio, Age, Career, Height, Net Worth, Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tyson-james.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
