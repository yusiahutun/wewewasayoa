Designed by French architect <strong>Paul Duboy</strong>, the <strong>Ansonia occupies a full city block on Broadway between 73rd and 74th Street</strong>. Its 17 stories tower above the streets below with 400 unique units inside. It's a Parisian-inspired design with Juliet balconies, floor-to-ceiling windows, and a marbled spiral staircase. Today, a 3,000+ square foot, four-bed, three-bath unit in the building is, according to Vanity Fair, listed at around $9 million. But who was William Stokes, and how did he end up getting shot three times by his own girlfriend?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=william-stokes-made-many-enemies-throughout-his-wild-life>William Stokes Made Many Enemies Throughout His Wild Life</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/telemmglpict000344021165_16904551074260_trans_nvbqzqnjv4bqqvzuuqpflyliwib6ntmjwsx5rhseiwkoo9p9oq-ymek.jpeg><p>Stokes spared no expense when building his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1,400 rooms, 300+ suites, ballrooms, barbers, and bank</a>. <strong>Only Murders in the Building <a href=#>Season 2</a> sees a flashback to the Arconia's "infamous playboy" architect</strong> (Stokes-style mustache and all) who was responsible for installing peepholes in the walls through which to watch women. At the age of 42, Stokes saw a photo of 15-year-old heiress <strong>Rita Hernandez de Alba de Acosta</strong> in a shop window and decided to make her his teenage bride. Reluctantly, Rita agreed to marry Stokes for the money, provided him with a son, and divorced him at 21. She is alleged to have broken the record for the highest divorce settlement at the time, with $2 million in cash and $36,000 in annual alimony.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Keeping with the wild theme, Stokes' hotel featured a fountain in which live seals swam! His obsession with housing animals didn't stop there either, with four geese and a pig as personal pets, ducks, 500 chickens, six goats, and a small bear all housed on the roof. In 1907, the Department of Health <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">put an end to his "farm in the sky"</a>. During his second marriage to 24-year-old <strong>Helen Ellwood</strong>, William's 22-year-old mistress, <strong>Lillian Graham,</strong> attempted to blackmail him for $25,000 with their intimate love letters. <strong>At the Ansonia, the vaudeville showgirl ended up shooting Stokes in the leg three times</strong>. Stokes survived long enough for Helen to divorce him regardless, and during the resulting trial, Helen sought the opportunity to inform the judge of Stokes' 47 chickens still inhabiting the building, despite the Health Department's demands.</p><h2 id=arnold-rothstein-and-the-famous-39-black-sox-39-baseball-scandal>Arnold Rothstein and the Famous 'Black Sox' Baseball Scandal</h2><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like in Only Murders in the Building, where the Arconia houses <a href=#>celebrities like <strong>Sting</strong> and <strong>Amy Schumer</strong></a>, the <strong>real-life Ansonia frequently welcomed the stars of its day</strong>. Baseball icon <strong>Babe Ruth </strong>and boxer <strong>Jack Dempsey</strong> were regulars at Stokes' hotel, with Chicago White Sox's first baseman <strong>Chick Gandil</strong> becoming responsible for one of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Ansonia's most infamous scandals</a>. At the Ansonia, Gandil met gambler <strong>Joseph “Sport” Sullivan</strong>, former teammate <strong>“Sleepy” Bill Burns</strong>, former Detroit Tiger <strong>Bill Maharg</strong>, and boxer <strong>Abe Attell</strong>. Their plan was to throw the 1919 World Series for a payday of at least $10,000 apiece.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They were joined by a representative of New York mob boss <strong>Arnold Rothstein</strong>, the gambling king known as "The Big Bankroll". Rothstein was a famous gangster, who was <a href=#>portrayed on HBO's <strong>Boardwalk Empire</strong></a> by <strong>Michael Stuhlbarg</strong>, and who inspired the name of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Robert De Niro</strong>'s character</a> in <strong>Martin Scorsese</strong>'s <strong>Casino</strong>. Bookies had the Sox winning the World Series over the Cincinnati Reds by three-to-one, but the odds shifted after those in the know began betting heaps of cash on the Reds. After a string of losses and delayed payments from the gangsters, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the players dropped the fix and focused on winning again</a>, but ultimately lost regardless. Star hitter <strong>“Shoeless” Joe Jackson</strong> testified, admitting to accepting $5,000 from his teammates, but eventually, everyone was found not guilty, likely due to the intervention of <a href=#>Arnold Rothstein's political power</a>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/7-Unanswered-Questions-We-Have-After-‘Only-Murders-in-the-Building’-Season-2-feature.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="This 'Only Murders in the Building' Scene Gave Us Selena Gomez's Best Performance as Mabel">This 'Only Murders in the Building' Scene Gave Us Selena Gomez's Best Performance as Mabel</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Mabel deserves so much better.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This wasn't the only instance of Stokes housing gangsters and dirty deeds in his building, however. Like the mustache-twirling villain that he was, <strong>Stokes sought to take land once owned by the New York Orphan Asylum</strong>. He yearned for the dirt road of Broadway to be paved and orphan-free, making the Ansonia the "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">grandest hotel in Manhattan</a>". Once his dream came true, he invited racketeer <strong>Al Adams</strong> (known as "The Policy King" and "The Meanest Man in New York") to reside at Ansonia indefinitely. After two years, Stokes found Al Adams dead in Suite 1579 with a bullet in his head. The death was deemed a suicide but was possibly linked to unpaid debts. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stokes himself was considered a suspect</a>.</p><h2 id=the-ansonia-was-later-renovated-into-a-cabaret-club-before-being-turned-into-luxury-condos>The Ansonia Was Later Renovated Into a Cabaret Club Before Being Turned Into Luxury Condos</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/omitb-season-3-finale-martin-short.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>William Stokes died of pneumonia in 1926, and with Rothstein dying of a gunshot to the abdomen in 1928, that era for the Ansonia soon came to a close —but that doesn't mean the wild antics the building housed were over. The Ansonia was left to William's son, <strong>Weddie Stokes</strong>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who had no interest in running his father’s empire</a>. As a crooked landlord himself, Weddie soon ended up in jail. The Ansonia sold at auction to <strong>Jacob Starr</strong> for a mere $50,000. Starr had no interest in renovating the property and was pushing for it to be demolished, but in the 1960s he found an opportunity to rent the swimming pool-turned-basement to <strong>Steve Ostrow</strong>, who <strong>turned it into a cabaret sex club called the Continental Baths</strong>.</p><p>The site of Stokes' original Turkish baths was now a gay club complete with a waterfall, K-Y jelly dispenser, and even a designated orgy room. The club's patrons would often find themselves enjoying sex acts while simultaneously watching Broadway-caliber performances. The Continental Baths welcomed early career-making turns from <strong>Barry Manilow</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Bette Midler</strong></a> alike, the latter of whom rose to fame as "Bathhouse Betty", named after the Ansonia venue. In 1977, the Baths closed and were reopened as Plato's Retreat. One of the world's most infamous sex clubs, Plato's Retreat was a "clothing optional", members-only club that featured a 50-plus-person Jacuzzi, a backgammon lounge, an open bar, a full buffet, a disco, and mattresses on the floor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Upstairs, meanwhile, Starr rented the rooms out to residents. With the building falling into disrepair due to Starr's refusal to renovate, the residents formed the Ansonia Residents Association. They protested by refusing to pay their rent until the building was repaired and successfully appealed to the Landmarks Preservation Commission to preserve the building. Today, we have the Ansonia Residents Association to thank for its current luxury condominiums. The <strong>building</strong><strong>now houses wealthy residents from various industries, much like <a href=#>the fictional Arconia in Only Murders in the Building</a></strong>, and although its history is rich with murder, mayhem, and secrets, the Ansonia is now thankfully less dangerous than its fictional series counterpart... or is it?</p><p>Only Murders in the Building is available to stream on Hulu.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">WATCH ON HULU</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51kvK%2B42GakrqqUmr%2B0ecinZK2glWKvtrXLnaCnn12Wv6S7zaKYZqqVlrlw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fonly-murders-in-the-building-arconia-real.html&text=%27Only%20Murders%20in%20the%20Building%27s%20Real-Life%20Arconia%20Has%20a%20Scandalous%20History&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fonly-murders-in-the-building-arconia-real.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fonly-murders-in-the-building-arconia-real.html&title=%27Only%20Murders%20in%20the%20Building%27s%20Real-Life%20Arconia%20Has%20a%20Scandalous%20History" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fonly-murders-in-the-building-arconia-real.html&title=%27Only%20Murders%20in%20the%20Building%27s%20Real-Life%20Arconia%20Has%20a%20Scandalous%20History" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fonly-murders-in-the-building-arconia-real.html&title=%27Only%20Murders%20in%20the%20Building%27s%20Real-Life%20Arconia%20Has%20a%20Scandalous%20History" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fonly-murders-in-the-building-arconia-real.html&description=%27Only%20Murders%20in%20the%20Building%27s%20Real-Life%20Arconia%20Has%20a%20Scandalous%20History" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./olin-browne-jr-wiki-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Explore Olin Browne Jr's Biography, Parents, Wife, Son, Career, &amp;amp; Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./more-than-400-finish-second-annual-kisco-5k-in-mount-kisco.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="More Than 400 Finish Second Annual Kisco 5K In Mount Kisco">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
