He made the draft in 2008 before making his league debut in 2014. Since then, he has not only remained an important player for the Tigers but has also contributed to the success of the United States national baseball team. Here you will find everything you need to know about him.</p><h2><strong>James Mccann Bio</strong></h2><p>He was born James Thomas McCann on 13 June 1990 in Santa Barbara, California, in the United States. There he was raised by his parents, Carla McCann and Jim McCann.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Chris Froome Wife, Family, Height, Weight, Body, Doping Scandal</a></strong></p><p>Before his birth, his parents had lost an earlier child who had been born before his time – the stillborn. When his mother took him in, she was again told that her son’s chances of survival were very slim, and even if he did succeed, the chances were very high that he would have developmental difficulties. Since they were strong Christians, his parents remained hopeful as they continued to pray and watch what Carla McCann ate while she got enough rest. Months later, James McCann was born healthy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/James-Mccann.jpg><p>As soon as he was 4 years old, his mother began teaching him the sport for which he would become very popular. She also drove him to every game and tournament.</p><p>As a student, he received his education at Dos Pueblos High School, and from there he went to the University of Arkansas. He played well in both his high school and college and helped him get selected by the Detroit Tigers for the 2011 Major League Baseball Draft.</p><p>He really started his career with the Gulf Coast Tigers in the Gulf Coast League and later switched to the West Michigan Whitecaps in the Midwest League. James was promoted to the Lakeland Tigers where he played in the Florida State League. He rounded out his Minor League record after playing for the Erie SeaWolves and the Toledo Mud Hens.</p><p>His Major League baseball career began in 2014 when he made his debut with the Detroit Tigers, where he would stay until 2018 when he signed a one-year contract with the team worth over $2 million.</p><p>Aside from playing on his team, James has also played for the United States baseball team in the 2011 Pan American Games in Guadalajara. He won the silver medal with the team at the tournament. He also represented the States at the 2011 World Baseball Championship, where the team finished 4th.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Joel Edgerton Wife, Dating, Girlfriend, Height, Gay, Brother, Bio</a></strong></p><h2><strong>His Brother and Wife</strong></h2><figure id=attachment_25737 class="wp-caption aligncenter amp-wp-inline-086b83d24e4412010a175ea3dba11ca3" aria-describedby=caption-attachment-25737></figure><p>The Detroit Tigers player has a brother who is the only sibling he grew up with. Not much is known about him, however. However, there are many who believe that his brother is Brian McCann, who also plays in the MLB for the Houston Astros. Brian, for his part, has an older brother, Brad, who was selected by the Florida Marlins in the 2004 Major League Baseball Draft but didn’t make it to the Major League.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/James-McCann-and-Jessica-McCann.jpg><p>Looking at the timeline of his relationship, James is married to Jessica McCann, formerly known as Jessica Cox. She is a graduate of Western Kentucky University. The two became man and wife in 2014, and since then they have remained very close and highly religious.</p><p>The couple was blessed with a pair of twins – Christian Thomas and Kane Timothy McCann, who was born in December 2017. The birth of the twins, which took place two months before the date of birth, was not without challenges, as it was considered to be high risk. Fortunately, everything went well, as the children left the hospital in the last week of January 2018. He now lives with his wife and children in Fayetteville, Arkansas.</p><h2><strong>Height, Weight, and Body Measurements</strong></h2><p>James Mccann has a very good height, which will put him above many others, and an athletic physique. He has a height of 6 feet 2 inches and a bodyweight of 210 lbs. There is no publicly available information about his general body measurements, but as mentioned above, he has a good physique that would help him succeed in many other sports if he chose to do so.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kt6K5xKxkppuTlruvedainZ5lkqe8tbTEq2ShnZmctbV51p6goKCkYq%2BwsNhmpJ6Zo6q%2FprnEp6usZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjames-mccann-wife-brother-height-weight-body-measurements.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjames-mccann-wife-brother-height-weight-body-measurements.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjames-mccann-wife-brother-height-weight-body-measurements.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjames-mccann-wife-brother-height-weight-body-measurements.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjames-mccann-wife-brother-height-weight-body-measurements.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjames-mccann-wife-brother-height-weight-body-measurements.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./twin-flame-lyrics-mgk.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./twin-flame-lyrics-mgk.html>Machine Gun Kelly Song About Megan Fox</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./best-chocolate-spreads.html>11 chocolate spreads you NEED to try on Pancake Day: From Marks &amp;amp; Spencer to Lindt and M&amp;amp;M's</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./best-chocolate-spreads.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
