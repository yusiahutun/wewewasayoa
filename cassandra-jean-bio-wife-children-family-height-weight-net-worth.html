In 2003, she qualified for the semi-finals and also won the Miss Houston Teen USA.&nbsp;In 2004, she then competed and again stopped in the semi-finals.&nbsp;In the same year, she won Miss Corpus Christi and won the title.&nbsp;In 2005, she was in the top 10 of the Miss Texas USA pageant.&nbsp;Jean did not give up, she then participated in the 2008 edition of Miss California USA.&nbsp;However, after finding out about her presence on Next Top Model, she was dropped from the show.&nbsp;Cassandra was one of the judges for the Miss New Port Beach pageant.</span></p><p><span>Subsequently, Cassandra Jean focused more on acting.&nbsp;In 2009, she starred in the movie&nbsp;</span><span>2 Guys and a Dream</span><span>.&nbsp;She appeared in a guest role on the popular series&nbsp;</span><span>One Tree Hill</span><span>.&nbsp;Jean landed other roles in numerous series, including&nbsp;</span><span>CSI: Miami</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span>CSI: Las Vegas</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span>The Intermediates</span><span>, and many more.&nbsp;She starred in&nbsp;</span><span>Mad Men</span><span>&nbsp;and is best known for her role on the show.&nbsp;Jean starred as Nora Fries in&nbsp;</span><span>Elseworlds</span></p><h2><strong><span>His net worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>Cassandra Jean may not have won in every competition she’s entered, but she does well in many other ways.&nbsp;Her net worth is estimated to be around $1 million which she has given thanks for.&nbsp;Apart from acting and modeling models, she has also hosted some shows and profited from them.&nbsp;Jean won $500,000 from his appearance on the show 1 vs 100 in 2008.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family – Spouse, Children</span></strong></h2><p><span>Many are often confused when they see the last name Amell and not Whitehead attached to the name Cassandra jean.&nbsp;To clear things up, the model and actress was born Cassandra Jean Whitehead, but after her marriage to husband Stephen Amell, she is often referred to as Casandra Jean Amell.</span></p><p><span>Jean and Amell got married in 2012 and have been together ever since.&nbsp;Together they welcomed a beautiful daughter, Mavi Alexandra Jean Amell, in October 2013. Stephen Amell is a Canadian actor.&nbsp;He briefly competed and appeared in professional wrestling.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Body Net Worth – Height and Weight</span></strong></h2><p><span>For someone who has been active in the modeling world, Jean surely passes for cute, handsome, and soothing when it comes to physical attributes.&nbsp;She stands at a height of 1.73m which is quite commensurate with her weight of 55kg and is known for her slim and curvy body.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGibkajAorrDq5hmopWWu26uyKhksKGWmnqktMilm6udnmKzornIpbBmoJWetKnAjLCcop%2BYqXqvsdNmrqiqpJ18</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcassandra-jean-bio-wife-children-family-height-weight-net-worth.html&text=Cassandra%20Jean%20%20Biography%2c%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20Family%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcassandra-jean-bio-wife-children-family-height-weight-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcassandra-jean-bio-wife-children-family-height-weight-net-worth.html&title=Cassandra%20Jean%20%20Biography%2c%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20Family%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcassandra-jean-bio-wife-children-family-height-weight-net-worth.html&title=Cassandra%20Jean%20%20Biography%2c%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20Family%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcassandra-jean-bio-wife-children-family-height-weight-net-worth.html&title=Cassandra%20Jean%20%20Biography%2c%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20Family%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcassandra-jean-bio-wife-children-family-height-weight-net-worth.html&description=Cassandra%20Jean%20%20Biography%2c%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20Family%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./marty-lagina-heritage-personal-life-career-wife-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Marty Lagina History, Personal Life, Career, Wife, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kyle-hornsby-wiki-married.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Kyle Hornsby?
