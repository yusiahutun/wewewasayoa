He was a famous <a href=#>basketball player </a>who played for the Boston Celtics in the NBA for two decades. As mentioned above, the two met at a jewellery store where she was working. However, they did not get together immediately; instead, they developed a <a href=#>friendship</a> that lasted several years.</p><p class=align-left>After Bill’s second marriage, the two got closer, especially after Nault started helping him with various tasks. She was also a very good dominoes player, which impressed him. As they spent more and more time together, their relationship blossomed into romance, which led to a marriage in 1996.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4051e015db4cb8d7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mary Griffith: The life story and death of Bobby Griffith's mom</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Marilyn Nault and Bill Russell mostly kept a low profile for the duration of their marriage. However, Nault usually accompanied Russell during his few public appearances, such as basketball games and dinner events. The two also travelled around the <a href=#>world</a> around the word quite a lot.</p><p class=align-left>Russell and Nault led a blissful life. According to Russell’s daughter Karen, the pair were the ultimate couple and even had an arrangement that Russell would make Nault laugh at least once each day. But, sadly, after a little more than a decade of being married, their relationship was cut short when Nault passed away in 2009.</p><h2>Children</h2><p class=align-left>Nault and Bill Russell did not have any kids together. However, she was a step-mom to Russell’s three children from his first marriage. These are Karen Kenyatta Russell, William Russell Jr., and Jacob Russell.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3c963dea7e514179.jpg><p class=align-left>After Nault’s death, Bill Russell married Jeanine Russel (sometime around 2018).
