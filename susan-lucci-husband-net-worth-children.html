Helmut Huber is an&nbsp;Austrian-born chef and food-service manager.</span></p><p><span>Helmut was working as the executive chef at The Garden City Hotel&nbsp;in New York, and Susan was working as the waitress at that time.</span></p><p><span>As reported by&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Yahoo Lifestyle</a>, After seeing Helmut, Lucci asked one of her friends, ‘<strong>Who is that?’</strong>&nbsp;And her friend said, ‘<strong>He’s your boss, stupid.'</strong></span></p><p><span>She found Huber very self-possessed, very self-confident, and very funny during the time she met him. However, Helmut had already taken note of her, saying that he had a “wow!” moment when Lucci first showed up.</span></p><p><span>In the meantime, Susan got engaged with another man (Shades of Erica Kane). Her engagement party was arranged in The Garden City Hotel, where Helmut was working. Helmut was invited to the Susan engagement celebratory dinner by her mother.</span></p><p><span>As reported by<a href=# rel=noopener> AmoMama,</a> Susan told that,</span></p><p><span><strong>'I was thinking at the time that he was much more attractive than I even knew, and I shouldn't be feeling like that.'</strong> At that party, Helmut told Lucci's mother that <strong>'She needs a man, not a boy.'</strong></span></p><p><span>From that party, Lucci was certain that she had to end her engagement, although she wasn’t yet sure where her relationship with Huber would go.</span></p><p><span>Huber confessed to Lucci that he wanted to marry her. But Susan wanted some more time.</span></p><p><span>Lucci recalled one small romantic gesture which convinced her that Huber was a man worth keeping,</span></p><p><span><strong>'One night, we were on the sun porch of my parents' home. Helmut realized that I was cold. He took his socks off and put his socks on me,'</strong>&nbsp;Lucci shared, adding it was that moment when she realized, '<strong>This is somebody spectacular.'</strong></span></p><p><span>After dating for 3 months,&nbsp;Lucci accepted Huber’s proposal.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/celebs/susan-lucci-with-her-husband-helmut-hurber.jpg alt="susan lucci with her husband helmut hurber" width=650 height=520 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></p><p><span><strong>Susan Lucci with her husband, Helmut Huber (©: Forbes.com)</strong></span></p><p><span>Susan Lucci and Helmut got hitched on 13 September 1969.&nbsp;<span>The couple has been married for more than 50 years and has been blessed with a son&nbsp;<span>Andreas Huber</span> and a daughter <span>Liza Huber</span>.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Liza, an actress, was born on 22 February 1975 and&nbsp;</span>was cast as Gwen Hotchkiss in the television soap opera&nbsp;Passions.</span></p><p><span>Lucci and Huber celebrated their 51st wedding anniversary in September 2020.</span></p><h2><span><strong>What Susan Lucci eats to maintain her fitness?</strong></span></h2><p><span>71-year-old actress Susan Lucci still looks better than ever, sticking to a healthy diet and daily pilates routine. Lucci is just as disciplined about her diet as she is about her exercise routine.</span></p><p><span>She<a href=# rel=noopener> said </a>that '<strong>I rarely eat dessert, never snack, and I don’t eat a lot of bread and pasta.'</strong></span></p><p><span>Lucci starts her day with a cup of coffee with organic sugar and whole milk. Lucci gets her workout&nbsp;with a pilates routine done before her breakfast.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>She takes Greek yogurt with organic pumpkin seeds and lingonberries. On cheat days, she splurges on eggs or her husband's blueberry pancakes.</span></p><p><span>For lunch, she substitutes bread with a base of beefsteak tomatoes. She then tops that off with slices of roasted turkey, avocado, salt & pepper, champagne vinegar, olive oil, and fresh mango.</span></p><p><span>However, Lucci does <a href=# rel=noopener>reveal</a> that <strong>'I wasn't&nbsp;always&nbsp;eating this healthy. Before I was working out, if somebody told me that I would actually choose fruit over french fries, I would never believe them.'&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p><span>Dinner is "date night" for her and her husband, chef Helmut Huber. The couple cooks up a light salad to start, along with an entrée of salmon, broccoli, and steamed carrots. They also pair it with some champagne, as it's always good to have a little bubbly.</span></p><p><span>She carefully restricts her alcohol intake. She only has one glass of champagne when they go out to dine, but she does not drink at home.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunCvxKWcm6qZqbamv46srKyZnmK5tq%2FComShraOXrq%2BwjKecrWWnpL%2B1tIycn6KklKeyrw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsusan-lucci-husband-net-worth-children.html&text=Who%20Is%20Susan%20Lucci%3f%20Who%20Is%20She%20Married%20To%3f%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Fitness%2c%20%26amp%3b%20Children&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsusan-lucci-husband-net-worth-children.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsusan-lucci-husband-net-worth-children.html&title=Who%20Is%20Susan%20Lucci%3f%20Who%20Is%20She%20Married%20To%3f%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Fitness%2c%20%26amp%3b%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsusan-lucci-husband-net-worth-children.html&title=Who%20Is%20Susan%20Lucci%3f%20Who%20Is%20She%20Married%20To%3f%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Fitness%2c%20%26amp%3b%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsusan-lucci-husband-net-worth-children.html&title=Who%20Is%20Susan%20Lucci%3f%20Who%20Is%20She%20Married%20To%3f%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Fitness%2c%20%26amp%3b%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsusan-lucci-husband-net-worth-children.html&description=Who%20Is%20Susan%20Lucci%3f%20Who%20Is%20She%20Married%20To%3f%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Fitness%2c%20%26amp%3b%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./exclusive-jenson-button-shares-rare-insight-into-marriage-with-wife-brittny-and-how-their-kids-deal-with-the-pressures-of-his-fame.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Exclusive: Jenson Button shares rare insight into marriage with wife Brittny and how their kids deal">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./we-can-do-hard-things-emotionally-immature-parents-glennon-doyle.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="This Podcast Perfectly Explains Why Your Relationship With Your Parents Is Strained">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
