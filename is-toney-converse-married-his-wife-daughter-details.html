So, what’s going on in Toney’s life today? Is he married? And who’s his daughter? Find answers below.</span></p><h3><b>Where Is Pitbulls & Parolees Star Toney Converse Today?</b></h3><p><span>Today, as of Nov 2022, Toney Converse is still living his life dedicated to the welfare of Pitbulls. However, the last post he made on his was in September 2021, captioned, “As we strive toward making divine connections, #ThankYou for allowing us to give them what they deserve.” with hashtags #adoptdontshop #dogsofinstagram #rescuedogs #hospicecare and more.</span></p><p><span>It’s clear that he continued his efforts even after leaving </span><a href=#><i><span>Pitbulls & Parolees</span></i></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Also, his rape charges were dropped back in 2016 after lawyers vindicated Toney with the help of email and text message conversations which allegedly prove Stampfel was “obsessed” and “in love” with him. “The witnesses interviewed and the circumstances described in the report, the matter does not merit prosecution,” First Assistant District Attorney, Graymond Martin said.</span></p><p><span>The alleged victim, Jennifer Stampfel, had filed a lawsuit filed in June 2015 claiming that Toney “drugged her, raped her twice, stole her virginity, transmitted an STD to her, impregnated (her), and threatened to kill her.” She said Toney, whom she first met when she visited an animal shelter, invited her for drinks a few months later in June.</span></p><p><span>At the bar, Toney handed Stampfel a glass of Coca-Cola she remembers as tasting off, and later she “began to feel strange, light-headed and like she was losing control of her motor skills.”</span></p><p><span>Toney then led her back to a home on Franklin Avenue and assaulted her. The next morning, Toney allegedly also joked about spiking her drink and warned her not to tell anyone about what happened.</span></p><p><span>So, knowing she’d been raped, the victim went to a doctor, got the results, and decided she was going to confront Converse. However, when she met with Converse, she says he threatened her, pushed her, and later forced her to perform oral sex on him.</span></p><h3><b>Is Toney Converse Married?</b></h3><p><span>No, as of 2022, Toney Converse wasn’t married. However, he was in a committed relationship then and had already met his possible future wife.</span></p><h3><b>Toney Converse Wife</b></h3><p><span>Right around the time Toney Converse was accused of sexual assault, he met his possible future wife, Emily Alexandra, thanks to their mutual love for Pitbulls. Their earliest IG post dates back to March 2015.</span></p><p><span>Since then, the two have been inseparable. And now (as of 2022) the two share a beautiful daughter named Luna Elizabeth. Also, it seems Toney has a son named Hassiv (Born: July 12, 2015).</span></p><p><span>According to Emily, Hassive was “the silliest most creative, and wonderful human that lights up our days and inspires me to always explore.”</span></p><p><span>As a family of four, they were on their first trip to Baltimore, Maryland in July 2021.</span></p><p><span>Talking a little about Emily, she owned a small graphic design business in New Orleans, LA. Most of her designs were based on a pug (the dog breed) like a Pug travel mug, Pug pouch, Pug android case, Pug coffee table, Pug counter stool, and so on.</span></p><p><span>Find Emily on Facebook @</span><a href=#><span>emxdeez</span></a><span> and Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>emilyalexandra___</span></a><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Toney Converse Daughter</b></h3><p><span>Toney Converse has a daughter named Luna Elizabeth.</span></p><p><span>Luna was born on March 4, 2019, the day Toney and his possible future wife, Emily were finishing that Tupac and biggie TV series. “My water broke, but I wasn’t having contractions at all,” Emily recalled. So, they rushed to the hospital only to be stopped by a big old Mardi Gras parade.</span></p><p><span>Thankfully, after a lot of struggle (with allegedly cops not helping them at all), the duo reached the hospital.</span></p><p><span>Likewise, reflecting on his past life, Toney shared that he’s now proud to be a father. On Father’s day 2020, he took to his IG to thank all of the brothers along his life’s journey that helped raise him. But he confessed that to become a better man he “had to study and take from every great one met along the way. From the many beasts in my hood; #elmstreet, always holding it down. To the angels I’ve had along every corner; from 309 to the bing! Up until my release, to where I am now.”</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Toney Converse Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>Toney Converse garnered a net worth of above $400 thousand in 2022.</span></p><p><span>So far, he’s had jobs as a Vip host/barback at </span><i><span>Club Ampersand</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Kappa Designs LLC</span></i><span>, and Rescuer, caretaker, and rehabilitator for abused/mistreated Pitbulls at </span><i><span>Villalobos Rescue Center – Life 4 Paws, Inc</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>As for his education, Toney attended </span><i><span>East Jefferson High School</span></i><span> and later studied Psychology at </span><i><span>Tulane University</span></i><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Toney Converse Age</b></h3><p><span>Toney Converse was 40 years of age in 2022.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>Where Is Toney Converse From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Toney hails from New Orleans, Louisiana.
