He first exploded onto the scene with his breakthrough role in <a href=#><strong>Luca Guadagnino</strong></a>'s <strong>Call Me by Your Name</strong>, a role that earned him a nomination for Best Actor at the Oscars, making him the youngest nominee in that category in over 80 years. Since then, he has forged quite the filmography for himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chalamet ended last year by starring in the prequel film <strong>Wonka</strong>, the latest film by <strong>Paddington 2</strong> director <strong>Paul Kin</strong><strong>g</strong>, and 2024 will also see the release of <strong>Dune: Part Two</strong>, while Chalamet is set to play <strong>Bob Dylan</strong> in the upcoming biopic <strong>A Complete Unknown</strong> by director <strong>James Mangold</strong>. Already, his filmography is quite impressive. Here is a ranking of Chalamet's best films so far.</p><h2 id=hostiles><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Hostiles</span></h2><h3 id=directed-by-scott-cooper>Directed by Scott Cooper</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hostiles-timothee-chalamet.jpg><p><strong><a href=#>Hostiles</a> may be the most brutal film that Chalamet has appeared in.</strong> It’s a solid Western with beautiful cinematography and outstanding performances, but it’s also gloomy and a bummer to watch. <a href=#>Hostiles shows the brutality of the old West</a>, especially when walking through hostile territory during this time. It’s slow-paced but has an intriguing, emotional story that keeps you invested. Director <strong>Scott Cooper</strong> doesn’t hold back from portraying incredibly violent action scenes that add to the harshness seen in this film. Chalamet isn’t in Hostiles much as most of the time is spent with <strong>Christian Bale</strong> and <strong>Rosamund Pike</strong>’s characters, but Chalamet still puts on a good performance when he’s on camera. Hostiles is very different from other movies Chalamet has appeared in but it still shows how versatile he is by placing him in a more harrowing environment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mv5bnjfhzjm4zdytmgrjyi00yzc2lwexymetmdq3nza4odu4ytljxkeyxkfqcgdeqxvynjkwmzu3ndi-_v1_.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Hostiles</h5>RDramaHistoryWestern<p class=display-card-description>In 1892, a legendary Army Captain reluctantly agrees to escort a Cheyenne chief and his family through dangerous territory.</p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>December 22, 2017</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Rosamund Pike</a> , <a data-id href=#>Christian Bale</a> , <a data-id href=#>Timothee Chalamet</a> , <a data-id href=#>Wes Studi</a> , <a data-id href=#>Jesse Plemons</a> , <a data-id href=#>Adam Beach</a> , <a data-id href=#>Ben Foster</a> , <a data-id href=#>Rory Cochrane</a> , Paul Anderson</span> <strong>Runtime</strong> <span>127</span><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Rent on Amazon</a></span></p><h2 id=beautiful-boy><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Beautiful Boy</span></h2><h3 id=directed-by-felix-van-groeningen>Directed by Felix van Groeningen</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/David-and-Nic-from-Beautiful-Boy.jpg><p>Based on the memoirs by <strong>Nic Sheff</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Beautiful Boy</strong></a> stars Chalamet as Nic, a college-aged teen who struggles with a crippling drug addiction. Not only does this addiction hurt his physical and mental health but it also impacts his family, especially his father (<strong>Steve Carell</strong>). Despite his many attempts at rehab and staying sober, he keeps relapsing and it almost seems like he’ll never get over it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Chalamet and Carell both give heartbreaking performances here.</strong> Chalamet has moments of desperation and weakness as he continues to spiral despite wanting to stay sober. Carell wants his son back and constantly feels like he is going to lose him forever to his addiction. The two work well off one another and both shine as these two characters. The film does a great job at showing the overall impact of a drug addiction and how it not only impacts the drug-taker but also those who care about them. Chalamet’s character is a good person and his performance makes you root for him and feel sympathy for him when he can’t fight temptation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beautiful-boy-poster.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Beautiful Boy</h5>RDramaBiography<p class=display-card-description>Based on the best-selling pair of memoirs from father and son David and Nic Sheff, Beautiful Boy chronicles the heartbreaking and inspiring experience of survival, relapse and recovery in a family coping with addiction over many years.</p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>October 12, 2018</span> <strong>Director</strong> <span>Felix Van Groeningen</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Steve Carell</a> , <a data-id href=#>Timothee Chalamet</a> , <a data-id href=#>Maura Tierney</a> , Christian Convery , Oakley Bull , <a data-id href=#>Kaitlyn Dever</a></span> <strong>Runtime</strong> <span>112</span><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Watch on Amazon Prime</a></span></p><h2 id=the-king><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The King</span></h2><h3 id=directed-by-david-mich-ocirc-d>Directed by David Michôd</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/the-king-timothee-chalamet.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>The King</strong> is based on many of <strong>Shakespeare</strong>’s plays surrounding Henry V. Chalamet stars as Henry, the young king of England who inherits the throne after his father dies and must navigate the current war with France. Chalamet gives an impressive performance as a seemingly immature, rich prince who steps up to the plate once he’s given a massive responsibility. However, his new responsibilities force him to sever relationships with former friends like Falstaff (<strong>Joel Edgerton</strong>), depicted as a more toned-down version of the character from Shakespeare. <a href=#><strong>Robert Pattinson</strong></a> also plays a delightfully hatable villain who chews up every scene.</p><p><strong>Director David Michôd leans into the darker aspects of this story as the film is very gloomy and often joyless. </strong>The gore is fully on display and it’s disturbingly realistic. It’s a slow-paced film but it also contains some well-directed battle sequences and emotional scenes that will keep you invested throughout. There are moments that Shakespeare fans will recognize from his plays but this movie is more concerned about portraying the historical aspects of this story rather than adapting a play.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/the-king-2019-film-poster.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>The King (2019)</h5>RDramaBiographyHistory<p class=display-card-description></p><p data-testid=plot>Hal, wayward prince and heir to the English throne, is crowned King Henry V after his tyrannical father dies.

But Chalamet's performance in the lead role doesn't attempt to wink at the portrayals of the character from <strong>Gene Wilder</strong> or <strong>Johnny Depp</strong>, but makes the performance his own. This version of Wonka is playful, charming, and a delightful optimist that longs to become a chocolatier that people will magic. This version of Wonka mixes sweet treats with magic, and similarly, Chalamet brings a sort of magic to the character. Wonka might be the most over-the-top, silly side of Chalamet that we've seen so far, but hopefully it's not the last, as the actor seems to be having a ball in that top hat. —Ross Bonaime</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mv5bndm4ntk0njktzdjhmi00mmfmltlimzetn2rkzdy2otnimdgzxkeyxkfqcgdeqxvymtuzmtg2odkz-_v1_.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title=Wonka>Wonka</a></h5>PGFantasyAdventurechildrenFamily<p class=display-card-description>Based on the extraordinary character at the center of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, 'Wonka' tells the wondrous story of how the world's greatest inventor, magician and chocolate-maker became the beloved Willy Wonka we know today.</p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>December 15, 2023</span> <strong>Director</strong> <span>Paul King</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Timothee Chalamet</a> , <a data-id href=#>Hugh Grant</a> , <a data-id href=#>Olivia Colman</a> , <a data-id href=#>Keegan Michael Key</a> , <a data-id href=#>Rowan Atkinson</a> , <a data-id href=#>Sally Hawkins</a></span> <strong>Runtime</strong> <span>116 minutes</span><h2 id=interstellar><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Interstellar</span></h2><h3 id=directed-by-christopher-nolan>Directed by Christopher Nolan</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/interstellar-timothee-chalamet.jpg><p>You would be forgiven if you completely forgot that Chalamet is in <strong>Interstellar</strong>, as he isn’t in it all that much and he is a lot younger. Chalamet plays a young Tom (later played by <strong>Casey Affleck</strong>), the son of <strong>Matthew McConaughey</strong>’s character who ends up going on an almost impossible mission to space to find a new home as the Earth is dying. Interstellar is a trippy space epic featuring <a href=#><strong>Christopher Nolan</strong></a>’s trademark of interesting twists combined with a sci-fi element.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The imagery is unbelievable to look at and brings to life scientific theories about space that have never been seen before. The score from <strong>Hans Zimmer</strong> also adds a majestic and almost magical feeling to this film. Interstellar does sometimes get lost in its complexity but it is still gripping, especially with the relationship between McConaughey and his daughter, played by <strong>Jessica Chastain</strong>. <strong>Chalamet’s character is somewhat pushed to the side but it’s cool to see him in one of Nolan’s most ambitious films.</strong></p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Watch on Prime Video</a></span></p><h2 id=lady-bird><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Lady Bird</span></h2><h3 id=directed-by-greta-gerwig>Directed by Greta Gerwig</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/lady-bird-timothee-chalamet.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#><strong>Lady Bird</strong></a> is a coming-of-age story starring <a href=#><strong>Saoirse Ronan</strong></a> as a high school senior who comes into direct conflict with her family and friends as she struggles to figure out where she wants to go in life. Ronan puts up a phenomenal performance, even though her character is somewhat unlikable. In fact, it’s hard to find anyone to root for in this story, especially Chalamet’s character who initially seems like a cool hipster character but turns out to be an untrustworthy jerk.</p><p><strong>His performance is very one-note but that’s the point.</strong> It’s hard to hate Chalamet in anything but he plays a smug, shallow teen so well that he gets you to dislike him. However, he still does enough to separate himself from being a standard cool boy in a teen movie. The movie as a whole does do a great job at showing Ronan’s struggles and how her actions conflict with her parents, especially her mother (<strong>Laurie Metcalf</strong>). They have awesome chemistry and their relationship feels authentic. Director <a href=#><strong>Greta Gerwig</strong></a> captures the awkwardness, drama, and uncertainty that comes with being a high school senior exceptionally well and the performances all come together to create intriguing characters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mv5bodhkzge0ndqtzdc0zi00ymq4lwjinmutyty1ogm1odrmngvkxkeyxkfqcgdeqxvymtmxodk2otu-_v1_.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Lady Bird</h5>RComedyComing-of-Age<p class=display-card-description>In 2002, an artistically inclined 17-year-old girl comes of age in Sacramento, California.</p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>September 8, 2017</span> <strong>Director</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Greta Gerwig</a></span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Saoirse Ronan</a> , <a data-id href=#>Laurie Metcalf</a> , Tracy Letts , <a data-id href=#>Lucas Hedges</a> , <a data-id href=#>Timothee Chalamet</a> , Elizabeth 'Beanie' Feldstein</span> <strong>Runtime</strong> <span>93 minutes</span><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on Netflix</a></span></p><h2 id=little-women><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Little Women</span></h2><h3 id=directed-by-greta-gerwig>Directed by Greta Gerwig</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/little-women.jpg><p>Another Gerwig outing, <a href=#><strong>Little Women</strong></a> follows the story of four sisters (Saoirse Ronan, <strong>Florence Pugh</strong>, <strong>Emma Watson</strong>, and <strong>Eliza Scanlen</strong>) in the era shortly after the Civil War. The movie follows these sisters as they all navigate being women in a society where their role is often limited to being a housewife who is dependent on their husbands. However, the sisters, especially Jo (Ronan), try to challenge norms and make their own mark in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chalamet plays Laurie, a close friend of the four sisters who finds himself entangled in different romantic relationships with two of the sisters. Chalamet oozes charisma in this role and has tremendous chemistry with both Ronan and Pugh, who his character is most closely involved with. Little Women wisely focuses more on the relationships between the sisters and how their different goals come into conflict with one another. There isn’t much of an overall plot but Gerwig gives us an in-depth look at this family and the challenges that come with being a woman during this time. <strong>It’s a movie filled with heartbreak, love, tragedy, and hope and it all comes together beautifully.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/little-women-poster.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Little Women">Little Women</a></h5>PGDrama<p class=display-card-description>Jo March reflects back and forth on her life, telling the beloved story of the March sisters - four young women, each determined to live life on her own terms.</p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>December 25, 2019</span> <strong>Director</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Greta Gerwig</a></span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Eliza Scanlen</a> , Emma Watson , <a data-id href=#>Timothee Chalamet</a> , <a data-id href=#>Saoirse Ronan</a> , <a data-id href=#>Meryl Streep</a> , <a data-id href=#>Florence Pugh</a></span> <strong>Runtime</strong> <span>135</span><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Rent on Amazon</a></span></p><h2 id=bones-and-all><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Bones and All</span></h2><h3 id=directed-by-luca-guadagnino>Directed by Luca Guadagnino</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bones-and-all-timothee-chalamet-lee.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Surprisingly, Chalamet’s most graphic film also features one of his most sensitive performances.</strong> Despite his stardom, Chalamet has never struggled to identify the outsiders in society, and why they’re doomed to walk their own paths. In Luca Guadagnino’s heartbreaking adaptation of the <strong>Camille DeAngelis</strong> novel of the same name, he stars as the young cannibal, Lee. Lee cannot hold back his inner nature; he’s been forced to fend for himself after a traumatizing experience with his father. He inherently fears that any happiness he’s granted by the world is destined to be taken away from him. Chalamet is particularly charming during his initial interactions with Maren Yearly (Taylor Russell), another young drifting cannibal who has been abandoned by her family. He shows a casual kindness in helping her escape from a store without drawing attention to either of them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lee’s dexterity in alluding to his issues and keeping them a secret showcases how long he has been alone; perhaps he’s only holding on to some sense of morality because it’s the only thing he has left. It seems like anyone he touches either turns away from him or ends up getting hurt. He even makes sure to keep a distance from his sister, Kayla (<strong>Anna Cobb</strong>), out of fear of drawing her into his circle. Bones and All isn’t a traditional “teen romance tearjerker,” but the film is only subversive because it is played so sincerely. It’s remarkably similar to<strong> </strong>Call Me by Your Name in many ways, including its incredible soundtrack of 1980s hits. Nothing about Lee and Marens’ cannibalism is stigmatized, and the moments of brutality are vivid and not glamorized in the slightest. It’s an incredible example of Chalamet’s bravery, and why he’s been hailed as the heir apparent to <strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong>. He’s unafraid to generate empathy from someone who seems like a monster. — Liam Gaughan</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mv5bmdy0zjuyytitzmflys00mji5ltljnmitodlimdkwmmy4ztvkxkeyxkfqcgdeqxvymtu0oda5ote2-_v1_fmjpg_ux1000_.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Bones and All</h5>RRomance Horror<p class=display-card-description>A young woman embarks on a 1000 mile odyssey through America where she meets a disenfranchised drifter.

Chalamet plays Elio Perlman, a young man living in Italy who begins a romantic relationship with Oliver (<strong>Armie Hammer</strong>). However, Oliver is older and is only staying in Italy for a short amount of time. Call Me by Your Name is focused on the relationship Elio develops with Oliver and his emergence into adulthood and discovering his own sexuality. It’s a story about love, heartbreak, and desire that also manages to be a coming-of-age story with plenty of depth. Director Luca Guadagnino does a remarkable job of capturing this beautiful story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/call-me-by-your-name-film-poster.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Call Me By Your Name">Call Me By Your Name</a></h5>RDramaRomance<p class=display-card-description>In 1980s Italy, romance blossoms between a seventeen-year-old student and the older man hired as his father's research assistant.</p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>January 19, 2018</span> <strong>Director</strong> <span>Luca Guadagnino</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Armie Hammer</a> , <a data-id href=#>Timothee Chalamet</a> , <a data-id href=#>Michael Stuhlbarg</a> , Amira Casar , Esther Garrel , Victoire Du Bois</span> <strong>Runtime</strong> <span>132 minutes</span><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on Netflix</a></span></p><h2 id=dune><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Dune</span></h2><h3 id=directed-by-denis-villeneuve>Directed by Denis Villeneuve</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Dune-Timothee-Chalamet.jpg><p>Yes, it’s one of his most recent films but it’s hard to deny the absolute visual sci-fi spectacle that Villeneuve created. Based on <strong>Frank Herbert</strong>’s classic novel, Dune features Chalamet as Paul Atreides, the heir to a powerful house in space that becomes intertwined in a series of political challenges and betrayals. Dune isn’t a sci-fi action spectacle. It’s more like space <strong>Game of Thrones</strong> where the focus is on the more political aspects of the galaxy. Chalamet is good as Paul and portrays him well based on how he is in the book. He is surrounded by a tremendous cast that includes <strong>Oscar Isaac</strong>, <strong>Rebecca Ferguson</strong>, <strong>Jason Momoa</strong>, <strong>Josh Brolin</strong>, <strong>Dave Bautista</strong>, and <a href=#><strong>Zendaya</strong></a>. While there are many characters and complicated sci-fi terminology, Villeneuve does a great job of making everything relatively easy to follow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The story is slow-paced but that just allows you to revel in everything that you are looking at. Visually, it’s almost a masterpiece, with grand, epic shots of the landscapes and flawless visual effects. <strong>This doesn’t feature Chalamet’s best performance, but it’s the best movie that he has been a part of.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/dune-poster.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title=Dune>Dune</a></h5>PG-13 Sci-FiAdventure<p class=display-card-description>A noble family becomes embroiled in a war for control over the galaxy's most valuable asset while its heir becomes troubled by visions of a dark future.</p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>October 22, 2021</span> <strong>Director</strong> <span>Denis Villeneuve</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Rebecca Ferguson</a> , Zendaya Coleman , <a data-id href=#>Jason Momoa</a> , <a data-id href=#>Timothee Chalamet</a> , <a data-id href=#>Josh Brolin</a> , <a data-id href=#>David Dastmalchian</a></span> <strong>Runtime</strong> <span>155 Minutes</span><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on Netflix</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51kwaq5zq2fnp1dmLWiuMCmnK1lnaTDqrHSZqmappuasXA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftimothee-chalamet-movies-ranked.html&text=The%20Best%20Timothe%20Chalamet%20Movies%2c%20Ranked&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftimothee-chalamet-movies-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftimothee-chalamet-movies-ranked.html&title=The%20Best%20Timothe%20Chalamet%20Movies%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftimothee-chalamet-movies-ranked.html&title=The%20Best%20Timothe%20Chalamet%20Movies%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftimothee-chalamet-movies-ranked.html&title=The%20Best%20Timothe%20Chalamet%20Movies%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftimothee-chalamet-movies-ranked.html&description=The%20Best%20Timothe%20Chalamet%20Movies%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./big-time-rush-member-hang-out-with-readers-poll.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Which Big Time Rush Member Would You Most Like to Hang Out With?
