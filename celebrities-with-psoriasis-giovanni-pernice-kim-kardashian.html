"I put my mind under stress moving into a different place and living on my own for the first time. It was a lot of hard work on my mind and body. And I feel like through that stress, my psoriasis started appearing."</p><p id=e4-Xeb44I-6c data-wc=34>Stumped at finding a solution, the star revealed as the years went on, he tried "everything" to find a fix.

Your body is fierce, it's cute, it's fine, and the more people that know about psoriasis, the more you'll stop having to tell cute guys about it when you take your top off," he told Allure. Jonathan had his first psoriasis flare-up when he was 23. In June 2018, he revealed he had been flare-free for six months, and explained that he credits this largely to journaling for "stress levels", as well as a dermatologist-prescribed steroid cream.</p><h2>9.

She said she took control "by taking care of myself and realising I have control over what goes in my body". "Really educating myself about my disease and how to manage it. As you get older, you realise it's just skin," she added. "If you're not going to love me because of what you're looking at, then you have issues with you, not with me. I know I have a lot more to offer."</p><p id=eqrhLzWFPJi1 data-wc=44>LeAnn now focuses on managing her stress levels to keep flare-ups at bay, by practicing yoga and working out.
