He explained the fraudulent activity that led to him losing a large amount of money, as well as losing all of his siblings within years of each other. The 69-year-old seemed quite optimistic about life years later, despite the tragedies. He said he tries “not to worry about things I can’t control.”</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-452625368-727x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-john-malkovich-s-tragedy-filled-decade-began-with-a-bad-investment><strong>John Malkovich</strong>‘s tragedy-filled decade began with a bad investment</h2><p>In December 2008, the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> actor’s business manager put his life savings into an investment with a man named Bernie Madoff. However, Madoff was later convicted of fraudulence that led thousands of people to lose a total of more than 60 billion dollars.</p><p>John <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> The Guardian: “Everything I’d ever made was gone.”</p><p>On finding out that his life savings had been stolen, he explained: “I saw a picture of Bernie Madoff in handcuffs and said to my wife: ‘I’m going to go to the corner to get a packet of cigarettes. I think we have a little problem with Madoff … [Afterwards] You know, that was a couple of days of shock, I suppose.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>ebastian Stan unrecognizable as Donald Trump as he heads to set for new blockbuster</a></p><p>Madoff was sentenced in 2009 to 150 years in prison for his crimes.</p><p>Talking about how his life changed after the incident, in which he lost “a lot,” the <a href=#>celebrity</a> said that he “stopped” paying for many things as well as giving out freely to his loved ones.</p><p>“Oh, I don’t know. A lot. But I don’t think it mattered that much. We just made changes to the way we lived and the money we spent.</p><p>“I had to do more work that paid for several years, and work all the time. And I stopped paying for everything. I just stopped paying for friends and family for a time. And we used to spend a lot of money producing movies that lost quite a lot of money. That stopped.”</p><p>He chose to look on the bright side of things despite his huge loss. John said: “After a couple or three days, you go: ‘You’re lucky to be alive, you’re lucky to have a job.’ Almost no one has money in the banks. I read somewhere that a huge percentage of Americans wouldn’t have $400 to put between their hands in an emergency.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-losing-all-of-his-siblings>Losing all of his siblings</h2><p>Three of four of John’s siblings all died within years of each other. Apart from the actor, they all followed their parents into journalism (his dad was an environmental journalist, and his mom was an editor of a local paper).</p><p>He said losing them was upsetting but was matter-of-fact about it and asked: “What can you do?”</p><p>“What can you do about it? Amanda, then Mother, then Danny, then Rebecca – and that was all over five years from 2009. I try not to worry about things I can’t control. Unless, say, you had a terrible mother, I don’t think anybody enjoys their family or siblings dying. I liked all mine. But what can you do? It’s the final act in life.”</p><p>“And that is how I look at life; I was very lucky,” he added. “I’ve been luckier than anybody I know. Luckier than all of the children in my family, all of whom were more interesting or more talented or smarter than me. So when things have happened that have been sad and difficult, I don’t feel the need to complain about them.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-loss-of-a-friend>Loss of a friend</h2><p>Losing family and the large sum of money wasn’t John Malkovich’s only brushing with grief and tragedy as earlier this year, his close friend, A Room With a View star Julian Sands died after going missing while hiking in the Mount Baldy area of southern California.</p><p>John said that he would “miss him every day.”</p><p>“We stayed incredibly close since then,” he said on starring in 1983 film The Killing Fields alongside Julian. “I’ll miss him every day of my life, but such is life. You lose a lot along the road until you’re lost. And that’s the way life ends, I’m afraid. I’m very sad about it, but obviously of course mostly for his children.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez’s dress leaves little to the imagination as she soaks up PDA with Ben Affleck</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2WGcLnOr6CeZaOprrN5yaifp2Wdlrmsu9WimqFlo6qzp7HRnptmpaWYtW6ywKagpbFdlrulecWipZqmk56urXnTq5ignZSueqq6jJ%2Bgr51drrKivtJo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmovie-star-john-malkovich-suffered-much-family-and-financial-tragedy-in-five-years.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmovie-star-john-malkovich-suffered-much-family-and-financial-tragedy-in-five-years.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmovie-star-john-malkovich-suffered-much-family-and-financial-tragedy-in-five-years.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmovie-star-john-malkovich-suffered-much-family-and-financial-tragedy-in-five-years.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmovie-star-john-malkovich-suffered-much-family-and-financial-tragedy-in-five-years.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmovie-star-john-malkovich-suffered-much-family-and-financial-tragedy-in-five-years.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-jam-podcast-with-jonathen-shenk-war-founding-member-lonnie-jordan.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-jam-podcast-with-jonathen-shenk-war-founding-member-lonnie-jordan.html>The Jam Podcast With Jonathen Shank: War Founding Member Lonnie Jordan</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./marilee-fiebig-birthday-net-worth-husband-wiki-parents.html>Marilee Fiebig Birthday, Net Worth, Husband, Wiki, Parents</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./marilee-fiebig-birthday-net-worth-husband-wiki-parents.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
