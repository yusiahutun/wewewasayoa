He has been involved in active politics since 1999 when he represented New York’s congressional districts from early 1999 until sometime in mid-2011. He was involved in several sexting scandals and then resigned from Congress in June 2011 when this became a public issue.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Anthony Weiner Wiki/Bio/Height</strong></h2><p>Anthony Weiner was born in Brooklyn, New York City, and lived with his family at one time in Brooklyn’s Park Slope district. He is of Jewish descent, as his parents are both Jewish. His father, Mort Weiner, was a lawyer, and his mother, Frances Finkelstein, was a public high school mathematics teacher. He is 1.78 meters tall and the second of three children, all boys – the older brother is Seth and the younger Jason. Seth was killed by a hit-and-run driver in 2000 at the age of 39, and Jason works as a chef and is a co-owner of several restaurants in New York.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Zoie Burgher Biography, Wiki, Instagram, Net Worth, Body Measurements</a></strong></p><p>Weiner attended Brooklyn Technical High School after completing the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test. He graduated from high school in 1981 and attended the State University of New York at Plattsburgh. He also graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science in 1985.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Anthony-Weiner-Wiki.jpg><p>During his time at the university, Weiner turned to politics, and he became very active in student politics, became very popular in the student community, and even rose to become a student senator. His influence was so significant that he was eventually named the most effective student senator. Immediately after school he went to Washington D.C. and joined the working team of Senator Charles Schumer, who was a member of the United States House of Representatives at the time. There he worked for three years, and in 1988 he was transferred to the office in Brooklyn, his home state, where his journey into real politics at the local level began.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Wife and Son</strong></h2><p>In May 2009, Anthony Weiner was engaged to Huma Abedin, a practicing Muslim woman of Indian and Pakistani descent, as a political operative. She was prominently featured in Hilary Clinton’s candidacy for the U.S. presidential election and was also a long-time personal assistant to Hillary Clinton. Abedin, born on July 28, 1976, was Vice-Chair of the campaign and had previously served as Hillary Clinton’s Deputy Chief of Staff when she served in Barack Obama’s administration as Secretary of State. Her romance with the Clintons dates back to the Clintons’ campaign for the 2008 U.S. presidency, where she served as traveling chief of staff and one of Hilary Clinton’s assistants on the Democratic nomination trail.</p><p>She eventually married Anthony Weiner, and the two married in July 2010, with former US President Bill Clinton officiating at the wedding. The closeness between Abedin and the Clintons was underlined when Hilary said at the ceremony that if she had another daughter (besides Chelsea Clinton), that Huma would be Abedin. In December 2011 the couple gave birth to a son, Jordan Zain Weiner.</p><p>Jordan’s birth came just six months after Anthony Weiner left Congress in disgrace after his first sexting scandal that led Weiner to take on the task of babysitting.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Atz Lee Kilcher’s Success With Alaska: The Last Frontier and Details of His Family</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Divorce/Separation</strong></h2><p>After the sexting scandal that led to Anthony Weiner’s resignation from the United States Congress, his wife Abedin announced that she would be separating from him in August 2016. However, the New York Post reported that Abedin and Weiner were trying to get their marriage back on track, claiming that the decision to go their separate ways was influenced by the Clintons, who said the scandal and Abedin’s continued association with Weiner would hurt their campaign. However, the attempt to patch things up obviously did not work as it did in May 2017 after Weiner pleaded guilty to the sexting charges in a federal court and was sentenced to 21 months in prison plus a $10,000 fine, his wife filed for divorce and sole physical custody of their son.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Anthony Weiner Net Worth</strong></h2><p>The net worth of Anthony Weiner is estimated at about $1 million. His wealth and riches were derived purely from his political career, as he has no connections whatsoever to any companies. He had invested a lot of hard work to get where he was, coming from a humble background.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Quick Facts about&nbsp;</strong><strong>Anthony Weiner&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><strong>Full Name:</strong>&nbsp;Anthony David Weiner</p><p><strong>Birthdate:</strong>&nbsp;September 4, 1964</p><p><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong>&nbsp;Virgo</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong>&nbsp;Brooklyn, New York City</p><p><strong>Education:&nbsp;</strong>Brooklyn Technical High School; State University of New York, Plattsburg</p><p><strong>Current&nbsp;Residence:</strong>&nbsp;United States</p><p><strong>Profession:</strong>&nbsp;Politician, Former Congressman</p><p><strong>Political Party:</strong>&nbsp;Democratic Party</p><p><strong>Nationality:</strong>&nbsp;American</p><p><strong>Ethnicity/Race:</strong>&nbsp;Jewish</p><p><strong>Spouse/Wife:</strong>&nbsp;Huma Abedin – 2016 (Separated in 2016)</p><p><strong>Children:</strong>&nbsp;1</p><p><strong>Favorite Sport:</strong>&nbsp;Hockey</p><p><strong>Net Worth:&nbsp;</strong>$1 million</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51krq%2FAx6ilsmWnmravsdFmrqKelWKxqsLOq5qeZaOku27DyKSgZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2aglZ60qcCMoKCrpJantqa6w2g%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fanthony-weiner-wife-divorce-son-wiki-net-worth-height-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fanthony-weiner-wife-divorce-son-wiki-net-worth-height-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fanthony-weiner-wife-divorce-son-wiki-net-worth-height-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fanthony-weiner-wife-divorce-son-wiki-net-worth-height-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fanthony-weiner-wife-divorce-son-wiki-net-worth-height-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fanthony-weiner-wife-divorce-son-wiki-net-worth-height-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./marie-helvin-71-proves-model-lingerie-age-shows-stunning-figure-racy-underwear-posing-photoshoot-mastectomy-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./marie-helvin-71-proves-model-lingerie-age-shows-stunning-figure-racy-underwear-posing-photoshoot-mastectomy-html.html>Marie Helvin, 71, proves you can model lingerie at any age as she shows off her stunning figure in r</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./trevor-gagnon.html>Who is Trevor Gagnon dating?
