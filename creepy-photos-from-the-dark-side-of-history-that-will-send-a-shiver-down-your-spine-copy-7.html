In the 1600s, complaints about smoke and pollution led to the implementation of legislation by King James I, although it proved ineffective. As industrialization surged in the late 1700s, London's situation worsened, with water vapor combining with coal particulates to create dense clouds known as smog, a term coined in the early 20th century.
