Jack stripped off his clothes and headed into the bathroom where he stayed for a long time. Finally back in bed, he plopped down and complained of a terrible pain at the base of his spine so she would have to get on top. The lovemaking didn’t last long. He turned over and said, ‘I’ve got to get some sleep’.<br></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The honeymoon in Acapulco wasn’t much better – quick passionate sex finishing early.<br></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>It was in Mexico that Jack told her about his Addison’s disease -- a rare, chronic endocrine disorder causing the adrenal glands to produce insufficient steroid hormones resulting in abdominal pain and weakness. His condition required constant injections.<br></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Kennedy also suffered from prostatitis that caused chronic pelvic pain and urinary infections. &nbsp;<br></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>But the worst was Chlamydia, a sexually transmitted infection of the urethra that had never been cured.

He always liked the woman to be on top because of his bad back. ‘In an impulsive move, he pushed me backward. My head was under water, and I felt I was drowning. This caused a vaginal spasm. But he had his orgasm’, she told her literary agent Jay Garon. She refused to speak to Kennedy ever again.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Lem Billings, a school friend of Jack’s from early days at the private boarding Choate School for boys in Connecticut in 1933, described Jack and Jackie as withdrawn, bitter people.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Jackie confessed to Lem they were like icebergs.

He had become Jackie’s confidante and recorded details of their meetings in his diary that would be leaked to the press after his private papers were donated to University following his death in 2002.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Initially she told the priest that she wanted to be with her husband in death. He advised her to live for the sake of her children. ‘Don’t mourn the dead, but get on with the living’.<br></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>On their last meeting, she stated she was still contemplating suicide but would give it serious thought before making such a rash decision. In a subsequent phone call to McSorley, Jackie confessed she was better because ‘love had entered my life in a way I never expected’. ‘It isn’t a love of which the Catholic Church would approve. In fact, the love I’m experiencing now would be called ungodly in the eyes of the Church. I wouldn’t even dare to confess it to you’, she is quoted by Porter & Prince.<br></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘At that point in her life, she was seeing Bobby Kennedy almost every day’.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><b><br></b></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><b>Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis: A Life Beyond Her Wildest Dreams by Darwin Porter and Danforth Prince and published by Blood Moon Productions is available on</b> <a rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=# style=font-weight:700>Amazon</a><br></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2Fd4CVbmpuZ3WtsK3B0qKtnmV5YsCxsc2doKefXaeytMCMpaCfnV1%2FrqS3jIScp6aVmcZulsCcoqKdXayur8DEnWSdoaakv6SxjKycq6GRoXqktMSaq6Kml2K1tr%2FBmqWdZX2Wv6q42Kdkhqeep7ymedKtqZqvXp3Brrg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fexclusive-i-spending-rest-life-jack-kennedy-jackie-wanted-divorce-serial-cheating-husband-marilyn-monroe-straw-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fexclusive-i-spending-rest-life-jack-kennedy-jackie-wanted-divorce-serial-cheating-husband-marilyn-monroe-straw-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fexclusive-i-spending-rest-life-jack-kennedy-jackie-wanted-divorce-serial-cheating-husband-marilyn-monroe-straw-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fexclusive-i-spending-rest-life-jack-kennedy-jackie-wanted-divorce-serial-cheating-husband-marilyn-monroe-straw-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fexclusive-i-spending-rest-life-jack-kennedy-jackie-wanted-divorce-serial-cheating-husband-marilyn-monroe-straw-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fexclusive-i-spending-rest-life-jack-kennedy-jackie-wanted-divorce-serial-cheating-husband-marilyn-monroe-straw-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./legendary-qc-mallards-generals-rivalry-returns-to-moline-march-4-for-big-genesis-benefit.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./legendary-qc-mallards-generals-rivalry-returns-to-moline-march-4-for-big-genesis-benefit.html>Legendary QC Mallards-Generals rivalry returns to Moline March 4 for big Genesis benefit</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./heather-rae-young-wedding-cake-dress-inspired-christine-quinn.html>Heather Rae Young's wedding inspiration from fellow Selling Sunset star Christine Quinn</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./heather-rae-young-wedding-cake-dress-inspired-christine-quinn.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
