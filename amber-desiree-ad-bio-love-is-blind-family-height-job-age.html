The show has returned with brand new faces from North Carolina who are willing to meet their soulmates while dating in a reality TV experiment setting.</p><p>Know all that you want about Amber while we unfold details about her age, job, family, and more.</p><h3><strong>Amber Desiree AD On Love Is Blind</strong></h3><p>Amber Desiree AD is one of the prospective singletons looking to find love on Netflix‚Äôs Love Is Blind.</p><p>Love Is Blind singles frequently enter the pods with a list of requirements for their ideal mate. Amber states before the show that it is improper to inquire about something as trivial as how she looks in the pods. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been ready, and then I meet people who are either halfway ready or lie to me,‚Äù she continues, adding that she spent time on men who weren‚Äôt ready for a relationship. ‚ÄúEmpathetic, smart, masculine‚Ä¶ who can handle her tendency to be a bit pushy at times,‚Äù is what Amber hopes to meet in a partner.</p><p>Netflix‚Äôs dating show is back on television screens when season six premiered on Netflix on February 14thm 2024. In the sixth season, the pods travel to Charlotte, North Carolina, where a fresh batch of single people goes on several dates through the pod walls in an attempt to discover their soul mate.</p><p>On February 14, 2024, the first six episodes debuted, and on February 21, Netflix released episodes seven through nine. The last episode will air on March 6 after episodes 10 and 11 are released on February 28.</p><p>Joining Amber are other 29 singles from North Carolina who share the same goal.</p><p>In January 2024, Amber announced her appearance on Love Is Blind with a post that she captioned, ‚ÄúAhhhhh YALLLL So excited to finally share that I‚Äôm part of the Love is Blind Season 6 cast. Love is Blind premieres this Valentine‚Äôs Day, only on Netflix. üíï&nbsp;<a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#loveisblind</a>&nbsp;<a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#libsnz6</a>&nbsp;<a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#netflix</a>.‚Äù</p><h3><strong>Are Clay Gravesande And Amber Desiree AD Still Together?</strong></h3><p>Given how Amber Desiree AD and Clay‚Äôs first encounter unfolded, it should come as no surprise that their romantic vacation to the Dominican Republic was just as exciting and fulfilling. The couple actually talked about their impending nuptials as if it were inevitable, pumped each other up at every turn, declared their love and physical and emotional attraction to one another, and talked some more about what they had in store for the future.</p><p>Even when they couldn‚Äôt agree on how he should handle her physical changes ‚Äúwhen‚Äù she was pregnant, they still had a friendly conversation about it instead of squabbling over his delivery and creating drama before moving on to more serious subjects.</p><p>Given that Amber Desiree AD first spoke with 36-year-old senior financial advisor Matthew Duliba, it was a bit awkward for her to speak with 30-year-old entrepreneur Clay. But when the latter started opening up to her in a way he had never done before, and the former made it plain that he was also completely devoted to her, everything turned upside down. She thus began to feel something for both of them, only for Matthew to disappoint AD by telling another girl what he was telling her.</p><p>It didn‚Äôt help that Clay became enraged about AD having a different relationship, particularly since she was already having trouble accepting his help because his appearance meant a lot to him. He had even gone so far as to ask her to give him a brief description of herself since he wouldn‚Äôt pop the question if he didn‚Äôt think she was pretty. However, he was fortunate enough to make some personal progress and realized that, as a result of witnessing his father‚Äôs behavior as a child, he frequently allowed his ego to take control, which led to an apology.</p><p>As Matthew pursued his other relationship, claiming that ‚ÄúAmerica is going to be watching,‚Äù Clay supported AD in a way that was unprecedented for him and acknowledged that he would push her. They then carried on joking around, confiding in each other about their darkest secrets and discussing their hopes for the future as they moved closer to their shared objective of perhaps spending eternity together. And although at first seeming like a simple playboy, the latter was able to overcome his reservations about physicality as they got to know each other better and started to fall deeply in love with AD.</p><p>Since AD readily accepted, Clay‚Äôs subsequent proposal to her was, if we‚Äôre being really honest, one of the most romantic ones in this episode. Then came their in-person meeting, which went far better than anyone could have imagined because they were instantly attracted to one another and were overjoyed to see each other.</p><p>The fact that they touched each other at every opportunity until he finally buried his head in her arms‚Äîbasically melting into her so that she could, in his own words, baby him‚Äîwas actually a strong indication of this.</p><h3><strong>Amber Desiree AD Age</strong></h3><p>In November 2023, Amber Desiree AD turned 33 years old.</p><h3><strong>Amber Desiree AD Family</strong></h3><p>Amber Desiree AD is the daughter of Jacqueline Desiree.
