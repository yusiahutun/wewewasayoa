The four previous champions will return to fight alongside a roster of East and West Coast chefs. The final challenger spots will be rounded out on the spin-off companion show <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tournament of Champions: The Qualifiers</strong></a>. But the real story is the one name missing from the list: embattled chef <strong><a href=#>Darnell Ferguson</a>.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Culinary geniuses from around the country are about to embark on a battle in the kitchen on Season 5 of <a href=#>the reality series</a></strong>, debuting February 18th on Food Network. Having originally aired in 2020 and now in its fifth season, Guy Fieri is back to host where he says in a statement to the press, "So here's the deal, in order to win, you've gotta either be a past champ or take down a champ, as all the winners from previous seasons are back to defend their titles." Those champions include, <strong>Maneet Chauhan, Tiffani Faison, Mei Lin</strong>, and <strong>Brooke Williamson</strong>, all dynamite female chefs in the industry. Alongside Fieri, <strong>Simon Majumdar</strong> and <strong>Justin Warner</strong> will host the series with Fieri's son, <strong>Hunter Fieri</strong>, conducting interviews backstage and behind the scenes. The eight-week run will feature 31 head-to-head battles where one chef will be named the winner of the Tournament of Champions belt, and earn $150,000, the biggest cash prize in show history. But before the main show can get underway, fans will watch 16 chefs battle for four 8th seed slots in Tournament of Champions: The Qualifiers. This show will air on Wednesday, February 7th, and February 8th.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/worst-cooks-in-america-cast-season-26.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="'Worst Cooks In America' is the Best Show on Food Network Right Now">'Worst Cooks In America' is the Best Show on Food Network Right Now</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>â€˜Worst Cooks In Americaâ€™ gives Food Network fans everything they could want from a TV show and itâ€™s something weâ€™ve never seen before.</p><h2 id=39-tournament-of-champions-39-brings-the-heat-through-intense-kitchen-battles>'Tournament of Champions' Brings the Heat Through Intense Kitchen Battles</h2><p>Like its previous seasons, Tournament of Champions follows an exciting template where two chefs go head-to-head. Through the single-elimination bracket-style format, which comes just around the same time as everyone's other favorite bracket tournament, <strong>NCAA Basketball March Madness</strong>, each round will force the chefs to showcase their culinary skills where <strong>"The Randomizer" will determine the specifics of the battle</strong>. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Randomizer, which has been stated to be rig-free</a>, forces the chefs to use a specific protein, produce, the type of culinary equipment they must use, a food style, and the time they have to cook. The unexpected excitement of the Randomizer not only keeps the chefs on their toes but also has the ability for viewers and fans of the show to learn about new food and kitchen items. Though some items are so pricey or exotic that the average food-lover may not have actual access to them. With an abundance of items, Guy Fieri stated that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">after an item has been used, it will be removed and replaced.</a> With no ability to properly prepare, Tournament of Champions brings the heat through intense kitchen battles. The stress is alive and well as the chefs not only can use a pressure cooker, but the pressure cooker within the studio overwhelmingly looms. With a live studio audience watching every move and cameras catching every angle, all eyes are on the chefs to produce their best work before feeding the guest judges in a blind taste test.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The success of competitive food shows on the Food Network has seemingly replaced the standard cooking programs the network was founded on. From <strong>Iron Chef</strong> to <strong>Chopped</strong>, <strong>Guy's Grocery Games</strong> to <strong>Beat Bobby Flay</strong>, this style of competition show plays into the brilliance of reality television while <a href=#>bringing beloved celebrity chefs into new realms.</a> Like the programs on <a href=#>sister network <strong>HGTV</strong></a>, the majority of viewers are novices in their respective fields. <strong>Viewers get to live out their cooking fantasies with the knowledge the food prepared may never see the light of day in their kitchens.</strong> The instructional programs may be relaxing, but it's the competition shows that provide exuberant entertainment and filthy fun. And like HGTV, when a fledgling Food Network personality rises to stardom, viewers are excited about watching their future appearances. And many of them do take part in some capacity in the Tournament of Champions as unofficial all-star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/worst-cooks-in-america-anne-burrell.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="'Worst Cooks In America' Co-Chefs Ranked from Best to Worst">'Worst Cooks In America' Co-Chefs Ranked from Best to Worst</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Anne Burrell is primary mentor of â€˜Worst Cooks In America,â€™ but when Blue Team mentor changes some are more fun than others.</p><h2 id=familiar-names-will-appear-on-39-tournament-of-champions-39-with-one-major-exception>Familiar Names Will Appear on 'Tournament of Champions' with One Major Exception</h2><span class=txt>Close</span><p><strong>Some of the food industry's biggest and brightest will sit behind the judges' table</strong> as they will be blindly served by the cast of culinary geniuses. To determine who is moving forward and who will be packing up their knives are <strong>Donatella Arpaia, Scott Conant, Cat Cora, Rocco DiSpirito, Susan Feniger, Lorena Garcia, Carla Hall, Michael Mina, Eric Ripert, Marcus Samuelsson, Nancy Silverton, Ming Tsai, Michael White, Jonathan Waxman, Geoffrey Zakarian</strong>, and <strong>Andrew Zimmerman</strong>. This mix of judges includes perennial Food Network show judges as well as celebrity chefs who have taken their shot on previous seasons of Tournament of Champions. Their expertise will be welcomed by the competing chefs as they will not only provide feedback on their dishes but also provide necessary empathy during this stressful process.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Through their press release, the first batch of competitors entering the kitchen Thunderdome were revealed. Bringing their culinary expertise from the East Coast include <strong>Eric Adjepong, Karen Akunowicz, Kelsey Barnard Clark</strong>, Season 2 champion <strong>Maneet Chauhan</strong>, <strong>Tobias Dorzon</strong>, Season 3 champion <strong>Tiffani Faison, Amanda Freitag, Jose Garces, Stephanie Izard, Marc Murphy, Britt Rescigno, Jonathan Sawyer,</strong> and <strong>Dale Talde</strong>. The fiery fighters from the West Coast will be <strong>Carlos Anthony, Shirley Chung,</strong> Season 4 champion <strong>Mei Lin, Antonio Lofaso, Crista Luedtke, Brian Malarkey, Shota Nakajima, Joe Sasto, Adam Sobel, Casey Thompson, Jet Tila, Michael Voltaggio</strong>, Season 1 champion <strong>Brooke Williamson</strong>, and <strong>Lee Anne Wong</strong>. Now with four slots to be filled in the Tournament of Champions: The Qualifiers and only 27 out of 28 names shared, it is likely the missing name is Darnell Ferguson, the celebrity chef that the Food Network has recently dropped. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ferguson is currently embroiled in charges pressed by his estranged wife.</a> As assumed by <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Andy Denhart </a></strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">of </a><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reality Blurred</a></strong>, it is likely if Ferguson was part of this cast, he may have lost the first round and would be edited out of the program. This wouldn't be the first time a reality show has had to edit out or minimize a contestants' appearance due to allegations outside the show. <a href=#><strong>RuPaul's Drag Race</strong></a> season 12 was forced to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">minimize contestant <strong>Sherry Pie'</strong>s appearance due to her sexual harassment misconduct.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even if Season 5 is their first season, <strong>viewers can jump right in and watch Tournament of Champions with the same excitement as long-time viewers.</strong> This show is a battle of the best of the best. Like any reality show, anything can happen. Long-time Food Network stars could be knocked out early in the competition by a rising star. One minor mistake in the kitchen can cause the entire battle to go up in flames. Regardless of the potential behind-the-scenes' drama, <strong>Tournament of Champions is the most anticipated culinary competition on Food Network, and it's destined to be iconic.</strong></p><p>Tournament of Champions Season 5 premieres on Sunday, February 18th on Food Network.
