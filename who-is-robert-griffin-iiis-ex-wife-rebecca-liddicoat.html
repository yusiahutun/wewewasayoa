Her parents are Edward and Laura Liddicoat. She also has an elder sister named Lindsey. Liddicoat went to High School at Copperas Cove. Following her high school graduation, she studied in biology at Baylor University.

She dabbled in uncharted business ventures following their divorce.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Rebecca_Liddicoat_And_Robert_Griffin_III></span><b>Rebecca Liddicoat And Robert Griffin III</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Robert Griffin III, a former NFL quarterback, was Liddicoat’s husband. The couple first went on a date in 2009 while attending Baylor University. Gryphon played collegiate football, and Liddicoat presided over her university’s Chi Service Club.</span></p><p><span>A mutual friend brought the couple together. Liddicoat claimed that Griffin’s “weird” sense of style did not impress her, therefore it was not love at first sight. He had on brightly coloured socks including SpongeBob SquarePants, Cookie Monster, and Scooby-Doo.</span></p><p><span>“When I first met him, I thought he was a little weird. I was a little nervous, and I asked him why he was wearing girls’ socks. He had on those weird socks he always wears,” she said.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rebecca-Liddicoat-2.webp alt="Who Is Rebecca Liddicoat?

Following a game against Kansas State in 2010, in front of family and friends, Griffin proposed to her. During her engagement party, he allegedly serenaded her with songs he had written.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>On July 6, 2013, they were married at the Four Seasons in Denver, which is not far from Boulder, Colorado, Liddicoat’s hometown. Families, friends, and NFL stars DeAngelo Hall, Kirk Cousins, and Santana Moss were all there at the wedding.</span></p><p><span>Reese Ann Griffin, the couple’s daughter, was born on May 21, 2015. However, a few months after the birth of their daughter, Liddicoat discovered the details of Griffin’s purported extramarital affair. There were rumours that he was having an extramarital affair with track athlete Grete Šadeiko. It is said that in January 2016, just seven months after the birth of his daughter with Liddicoat, Gryphon III and Adeiko connected on Instagram.</span></p><p><span>On August 16, 2016, their divorce was finally completed. Sources claim that the court awarded her full custody of their daughter Reese Ann along with a payment of $1.1 million. In addition, the divorce agreement stipulated that Griffin would give their daughter $36,000 a month in child support and that her ex-husband would contribute half of the Texas home’s value.</span></p><p><span>Griffin moved on with Šadeiko shortly after his divorce in 2016, and the two have been together ever since. Gloria and Gameya Griffin, the couple’s two children, were born in 2018 after they were married. It is said that a third child is on the way.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbXPraarp16YvK57z2iuoaddnsBuvs6bnKusXZy%2FqrLFoqVmoZmewG6x12auop6VYr%2BmrsScmpplnJ6xpbXCqJitZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-robert-griffin-iiis-ex-wife-rebecca-liddicoat.html&text=Who%20is%20Robert%20Griffin%20IIIs%20Ex-Wife%20Rebecca%20Liddicoat%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-robert-griffin-iiis-ex-wife-rebecca-liddicoat.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-robert-griffin-iiis-ex-wife-rebecca-liddicoat.html&title=Who%20is%20Robert%20Griffin%20IIIs%20Ex-Wife%20Rebecca%20Liddicoat%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-robert-griffin-iiis-ex-wife-rebecca-liddicoat.html&title=Who%20is%20Robert%20Griffin%20IIIs%20Ex-Wife%20Rebecca%20Liddicoat%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-robert-griffin-iiis-ex-wife-rebecca-liddicoat.html&title=Who%20is%20Robert%20Griffin%20IIIs%20Ex-Wife%20Rebecca%20Liddicoat%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-robert-griffin-iiis-ex-wife-rebecca-liddicoat.html&description=Who%20is%20Robert%20Griffin%20IIIs%20Ex-Wife%20Rebecca%20Liddicoat%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-build-a-classic-arched-backyard-bridge.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Classic Arched Backyard Bridge (DIY)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./where-hoda-today.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where Is Hoda Kotb on Today?
