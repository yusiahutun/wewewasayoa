<time>12 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Childhood was not an easy period for Zulekha Haywood, the first daughter of supermodel and entrepreneur Iman.&nbsp;Zulekha’s mother is very famous for her work as a supermodel, so when she gave birth to a female child, many thought her daughter would inherit the near-perfect looks and figures she was known for.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, that is not what happened. While photographers and designers walked all over themselves for just a piece of Iman, her daughter attracted none.&nbsp;It was difficult for her then, but she survived and is still kicking.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/iman-fotor-20230703221115.jpg><p>Here’s what you need to know about Zulekha Haywood.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Zulekha_Haywood_Parents></span>Zulekha Haywood Parents&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=#>Zulekha Haywood’s</a> parents are the renowned supermodel-turned-entrepreneur Iman Mohamed Abdulmajid and former NBA star player Spencer Haywood. Zulekha’s mother enjoyed much success in the fashion industry because of her beautiful features, including a long neck, a slender figure, and copper-toned skin.&nbsp;</p><p>She was recognized as a muse to famous designers, including Halston, Gianni Versace, Calvin Klein, Issey Miyake, and Donna Karan. Renowned designer Yves Saint-Laurent particularly had a noticeable soft spot for her. He was even known to call her his “dream woman.”</p><p>She was also Spencer Haywood’s dream woman until 1987 when their daughter was nine. After their split, the pair got into a custody battle in 1992. At the time, Zulekha attended high school in Detroit, USA. After her high school education, she studied at Michigan State University.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/zul-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Zulekha_Haywoods_Net_Worth></span>Zulekha Haywood’s Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to different sources, Zulekha’s net worth has been reported to be $4.8 million.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Zulekha_Haywood_Daughter></span>Zulekha Haywood Daughter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She married a man named Jason Young, and a year later, they gave birth to their daughter, Lavinia Rose Young.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Zulekha_Haywood_Age></span>Zulekha Haywood Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Iman’s daughter was born on July 5, 1978. As of the time of this writing, she is 44 years old.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Zulekha_Haywood_Instagram></span>Zulekha Haywood Instagram<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zulekha is active on Instagram. Her username on the platform is @goldie_spawn, and she has 1,595 followers with 559 posts.&nbsp;She enjoys posting cute pictures of her family and is generally always positive.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Zulekha_Haywood_and_Iman_Relationship></span>Zulekha Haywood and Iman Relationship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zulekha faced a lot of hardship as the child of a supermodel, and her mother, who was conscious of her weight, would always try to help her.&nbsp;However, Zulekha did not see it as helping. It took becoming a full-fledged adult to understand and forgive her mom.&nbsp;</p><p>She also has a close relationship with her father. He tried to win custody of her and accused Iman of being a terrible parent.&nbsp;He lost, but his relationship with his daughter remains good-natured.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Zulekha_Haywood_Weight_Loss></span>Zulekha Haywood Weight Loss<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zulekha had a difficult time growing up because of her weight. She struggled to get her weight under control, and the problems did not disappear as she grew older.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Since she was overweight, her mother put her on the ‘Basta’ diet. It saw her mother whisper the word ‘Basta,’ which means ‘enough’ in Italian, every time she overate.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/imm-fotor-2023070322841-993x1024.jpg><p>As a child, Zulekha temporarily gained some headway into her weight-loss journey, but she inherited her father’s midnight snacking habit, which affected her weight-loss efforts. She also felt inadequate because she <a href=#>believed</a> she did not look as beautiful as her supermodel mother, nor was she physically fit like her Olympic gold medallist father.&nbsp;</p><p>By age 8, she had tried various diets and was about 320 pounds heavy. It affected her health, but she became aware of that and decided to do something about it.&nbsp;</p><p>Subsequently, she decided to get gastric band surgery on her 28th birthday. It helped her gain confidence, and she completed her education and started her career. Zulekha studied at Mercy High School and graduated with a bachelor’s degree from Michigan State University.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Zulekha_Haywood_Siblings></span>Zulekha Haywood Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Iman’s daughter has four other siblings. After her parents’ divorce, her father married Linda Haywood, and they welcomed three girls: Nikiah, Isis, and Shaakira.&nbsp;Her mother also moved on with David Bowie in 1992. From their union, Zulekha got another step-sister: Alexandria Zahra Jones.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Zulekha_Haywood_Husband></span>Zulekha Haywood Husband<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She is currently married to Jason Young.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Zulekha_Haywood_Height></span>Zulekha Haywood Height<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zulekha is 5 feet 6 inches.&nbsp;</p><p>She is now in a better place and is more confident with her weight, like <a href=#>Adele</a>, Kelly Osborne, and Khloe Kardashian, who also struggled with weight loss.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kx7a4xKSfmmWYlsa4u86dZKKlkaPAbrDArp6hrJWneqOt062jnpxdrLa1tIyhnKtlp5q2qLTTZp2oql2ivLTAjKidZqCVp3qttcWeZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fzulekha-haywood-imans-daughter-battled-with-her-weight-for-most-of-her-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fzulekha-haywood-imans-daughter-battled-with-her-weight-for-most-of-her-life.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fzulekha-haywood-imans-daughter-battled-with-her-weight-for-most-of-her-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fzulekha-haywood-imans-daughter-battled-with-her-weight-for-most-of-her-life.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fzulekha-haywood-imans-daughter-battled-with-her-weight-for-most-of-her-life.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fzulekha-haywood-imans-daughter-battled-with-her-weight-for-most-of-her-life.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ive-told-38jj-boobs-inappropriate-refuse-breast-reduction-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ive-told-38jj-boobs-inappropriate-refuse-breast-reduction-html.html>I've been told my 38JJ boobs are inappropriate - but I refuse to get a breast reduction</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./392101-who-grand-p-a-living-html.html>Who is Grand P and what does he do for a living?
