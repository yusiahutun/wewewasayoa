In the films, several of the many siblings, and the parents play prominent and helpful roles. The <strong>family has also had a long tradition of being sorted into the Gryffindor House, with each member exemplifying immense qualities of bravery, loyalty, and honor</strong>. Despite being purebloods like the <a href=#>Blacks</a> and Malfoys, the Weasley family is known to have a fond admiration for non-magical people and a lack of prejudice regarding those with different blood statuses. They even all fought as part of the Order of the Phoenix to defend the Wizarding world from Voldemort (<a href=#><strong>Ralph Fiennes</strong></a>) in the Second Wizarding War.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though the family was never the wealthiest among wizards, <strong>their stacked house, <a href=#>dubbed "The Burrow,"</a> was overflowing with love and camaraderie</strong>.

Ron was by Harry’s side from day one, playing a pivotal role in every one of his adventures throughout the eight films. From navigating the puzzles of the Sorcerer’s Stone, to founding Dumbeldore’s Army, to playing Keeper on the Quidditch team, and <a href=#>helping hunt Horcruxes across the UK</a>, Ron was integral to Harry’s greatest achievements.</p><p>The two were such close friends that, in <a href=#><strong>Harry Potter and t</strong><strong>he Goblet of Fire</strong></a>, it was Ron who was chosen as Harry’s most personal connection to be a hostage in the second challenge. However, it wasn’t just his friendship with Harry that made him important, as <strong>his tactical mind, intimate understanding of Wizarding traditions, and fierce underdog personality</strong> made him a compelling character all on his own. As Harry was raised by Muggles, Ron helped him navigate many of the eccentricities of wizard life. He was a spark of refreshing humor and a reliable friend and ally over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=arthur-and-molly-weasley>Arthur and Molly Weasley</h2><h3 id=played-by-mark-william-and-julie-walters>Played by Mark William and Julie Walters</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince-arthur-molly-weasley.jpg><p>The parents of the Weasley household are <a href=#>Arthur (<strong>Mark Williams</strong>) and Molly (<strong>Julie Walters</strong>) Weasley</a>, who set an excellent precedent as role models for their children. Arthur Weasley was a firm believer in magical and Muggle equality, demonstrated by his curious fascination with non-magical technology and culture. One of his most memorable creations was the Flying Ford Anglia, an enchanted flying car that was used multiple times to save Harry Potter’s life. <strong>Arthur notably worked for the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office in the Ministry of Magic</strong> for several years before the onset of the Second Wizarding War.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-harry-potter-set-accident-that-is-more-terrifying-than-its-films.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="This ‘Harry Potter’ Set Accident Is More Terrifying Than Lord Voldemort Himself">This ‘Harry Potter’ Set Accident Is More Terrifying Than Lord Voldemort Himself</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Movie making can be a dangerous business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Molly was the kind, doting, and powerful matriarch of the Weasley family. She and Arthur had a total of seven children together, whom they raised with great affection. <strong>Molly was caring and protective of all her children, fiercely proud of their accomplishments while holding them accountable</strong> for their behavior. She was as quick to give a hug as she was to send a Howler to one of her kids. But even such a large household didn’t deplete her motherly energies, as she swiftly welcomed Harry into their family as well. However, don’t let her doting personality convey a misconception about weakness, as Molly was a formidable witch capable of holding her own, as shown in her defeat of <a href=#>Bellatrix Lestrange (<strong>Helena Bonham Carter</strong>)</a> in the Battle of Hogwarts.</p><h2 id=bill-weasley>Bill Weasley</h2><h3 id=played-by-domhnall-gleeson>Played by Domhnall Gleeson</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bill-weasley-domnhall-gleeson-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The eldest child of the Weasley clan was Bill Weasley (<strong>Domhnall Gleeson</strong>), who set a remarkably high standard for all his younger siblings. <a href=#>A Gryffindor, like all the rest</a>, he excelled during his time at Hogwarts and earned recognition as Head Boy.

His responsibilities included teaching first-years how to enter the common room, as well as monitoring their behavior throughout the school year.</p><p>Despite his academic and professional achievements, Percy was involved in the most inner conflict within the Weasleys. He <strong>became estranged from his family due to his commitment to the Ministry of Magic</strong>, in particular the Minister, who deeply mistrusted Albus Dumbledore and even denied the return of Voldemort.

The two were the trouble-making duo of the family that brought light and levity everywhere they went, but also became somber reminders of the horrors of war. Because they were identical, they often got mistaken for one another or grouped together. However, they were not perfectly the same, as Fred was more outgoing than his slightly more reserved younger twin. The <strong>twins ended up being older brother figures to Harry as well</strong>, as they played the Beater positions on the <a href=#>Gryffindor Quidditch team</a> and even gave him the iconic Marauder’s Map. Though the two brothers weren’t as academically gifted as their older siblings, they nonetheless had incredible magical talent. In their final year, they decided to forego graduating and instead went out in a spectacular flourish as they set magical fireworks throughout the castle <a href=#>in protest against the vile Professor Umbridge</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong><strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fred and George became entrepreneurs and<strong> founded the Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, a magical joke shop in Diagon Alley</strong>.

Though the <a href=#>film version of Ginny</a> never received as much spotlight as her book counterpart, she <strong>would eventually grow and demonstrate a fierce independence and abundance of talents</strong>.
