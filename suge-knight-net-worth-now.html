<time>25 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Ivanka Trump is the second-born child of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Donald Trump</a>, the 45th President of the United States, and his first wife, Ivana, as well as the oldest of two daughters born to her father.&nbsp;</p><p>She served as a senior advisor in his administration, as well as the director of the Office of Economic Initiatives and Entrepreneurship. Even after his presidency ended, Ivanka often stood beside Donald, supporting him in his endeavors.</p><p>She did the same in November 2023 when she took a stand for her father in New York and spent five hours answering questions about her father’s money, their properties, and her job with the Trump Organisation.</p><p>On another note, Ivanka has been hounded by plastic surgery rumors for years, and they were resurrected when she testified in her father’s $250 million fraud trial, displaying a remarkable face makeover as she came into the court.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Plastic surgery assumptions by surgeons</h2><p>To date, Ivanka has not confessed to getting any plastic surgery. However, netizens believe that she had had some procedures done, especially after comparing before and after pictures of the former White House advisor.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>As said before, the rumors resurfaced after Ivanka defended Donald in November 2023. Photos of her outside the courtroom were quite different from what she looked like before.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Daily Mail</a> believed that she had undergone plastic surgery and even consulted cosmetic and plastic surgeons. However, a source told them that their allegations were false.</p><p>Dr. Alexander Z. Rivkin, the founder of RIVKIN Aesthetics, believed that Ivanka has had work done on a number of her facial characteristics, including her nose and chin. He analyzed and came to the conclusion after comparing before and after photos of Ivanka.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>He said, “Ivanka Trump looks like she has had quite a makeover. Overall, her face now looks better proportioned, but less natural and more generic because her natural imperfections have been reduced.”</p><p>He noted that she had enhanced her lips with fillers and said, “In the photos from the front, they look good, but once she turns profile, the borders seem unnaturally prominent.”</p><p>Looking at Ivanka’s photos from 2020, Dr. Rivkin noted that Ivanka previously had a naturally narrow jaw and tiny chin, and these signature traits gave her a distinctive appearance.&nbsp;</p><p>However, because of plastic surgery, they were now gone. “She seems to have added, whether with filler or implants, significant volume to her chin and jaw. From the photos, it seems that she has somewhat over-enhanced and over-projected on her chin,” he explained.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=# rel=noopener>@IvankaTrump</a> is what happens when 30 years of plastic surgery and cosmetic procedures all fall apart at once.</p><p>Let this be a warning to you, kids.</p><p>Don't fight Mother Nature.</p><p>She'll turn you into a monster. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/RLybvTx4Kp</a></p>— Tennesseine (@Tennesseine) <a href=# rel=noopener>December 29, 2023</a></figure><p>He also assumed that Ivanka got non-surgical rhinoplasty with filler since the tip of her nose appeared “more projected and defined.” Similarly, he also believes that Ivanka’s cheeks looked “over-enhanced” with fillers.</p><p>He further said, “Her forehead seems to have been enhanced into a more rounded shape on the profile. This was probably done with hyaluronic acid filler.”</p><p>He noticed that the fine lines under her eyes were gone and said, “She could have had energy treatments such as laser or radiofrequency done to tighten her skin, or she could have had a surgical blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery).”</p><p>Board-certified plastic surgeon Norman M. Rowe, M.D., concurred that Ivanka’s alteration over the years was not due to makeup and lighting but, instead, plastic surgery. He also claimed that rhinoplasty was responsible for the ‘trimmed down’ tip of Ivanka’s nose and the ‘smaller’ bridge.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ivanka-Trump.jpeg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Ivanka Trump has been accused of getting plastic surgery by comparing before and after photos of her. (Source: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>)</p><p>“Her lower face and neck show a much more defined jawline and shapely, longer neck. This can be due to a facelift, which is hard to say on the photographs but is not uncommon in a 42-year-old, or something as simple as a halo laser of her face and neck,” Dr. Rowe explained.</p><p>Meanwhile, Dr. David Shafer, the founder of New York’s Shafer Clinic Fifth Avenue and a board-certified celebrity plastic surgeon, said Ivanka was already stunning, so whatever treatments or plastic surgery she has had are frosting on the cake.</p><p>After reviewing images of Ivanka before and after the alleged plastic surgery, he concluded that she had some mild lip augmentation, such as dermal fillers or a lip flip, in which the top lip is injected with Botox and flipped upwards for additional definition.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Shafer also commented on Ivanka’s chin, which had become more pronounced and prominent. “’It’s hard to tell from the pictures, but Ivanka has incredible cheek and jawline definition. Surgically we would use neck liposuction combined with Renuvion plasma skin tightening,” he pointed out.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>MD. Sergio Alvarez, MD, board-certified plastic surgeon & CEO of Mia Aesthetics, noted that Ivanka was a very beautiful woman. He said, “Looking at her photos, her profile photo looks like she had work done to the nose and chin,” to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Mirror</a>.</p><p>Comparing before and after photos of Ivanka, he noted that her nose, where there used to be a bump, is now pointing slightly up. He also assumed that Ivanka received a buccal fat removal surgery.</p><p>He said, “In the more recent pics, she looks hollowed out in the cheek area, which could be a procedure popular in Hollywood called buccal fat removal, where we [doctors] take out the fat pack in the cheek area. Or, they make the cheek puff out more with filler.”</p><p>When questioned if the changes were due only to age, Dr. Alvarez answered that she had done superb professional work on her face. He said that youth was seen in round, full faces, so receiving fillers might make you seem young rather than sunken.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>“The marks could have been surgical intervention, not just fillers, but they did a very good job of doing procedures appropriate to her age because people think with age everything sags, but you also get loss of fat, especially in the critical aspects of the face,” he noted.&nbsp;</p><p>He believed that Ivanka did have plastic surgery and said, “It takes a good plastic surgeon and a good patient as well.” Despite all the speculations about plastic surgery and procedures by comparing before and after photos of Ivanka, the former advisor to the White House has not addressed any rumors or accusations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e9Kunp5lm6O2qLTTZqWerF2svLPAx2alqK9f</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsuge-knight-net-worth-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsuge-knight-net-worth-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsuge-knight-net-worth-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsuge-knight-net-worth-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsuge-knight-net-worth-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsuge-knight-net-worth-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./pitmaster-dave-grohl-smokes-some-meat-for-beleaguered-los-angeles-fire-department.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./pitmaster-dave-grohl-smokes-some-meat-for-beleaguered-los-angeles-fire-department.html>Pitmaster Dave Grohl Smokes Some Meat For Beleaguered Los Angeles Fire Fighters</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./gigi-hadid-bradley-cooper-dating-photos.html>Gigi Hadid and Bradley Cooper Seen Out Together Amid Dating Rumors</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./gigi-hadid-bradley-cooper-dating-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
