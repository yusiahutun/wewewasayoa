Jenna’s career began with her role on Jane the Virgin, which was followed by a series of cult television shows such as You, Yes Day and Wednesday. Natalie Ortega, Jenna Ortega’s mother, is a California-trained nurse who also helped on a medical mission during the devastating 2010 Haiti earthquake.</span></strong></p><p><span>Additionally, Ortega is a devoted mother who frequently posts photos of her children on social media. Her Instagram and Facebook, in particular, are flooded with posts from Jenna. Let’s learn more about Jenna Ortega’s bilingual mother Natalie, from her family background to her ethnic heritage to her career as the mother of a successful star.</span></p><h2><span>What is the name of Jenna Ortega’s mother?</span></h2><p><span>Natalie Ortega is the mother of Wednesday actress Jenna Ortega.</span></p><h2><span>What is Natalie Ortega’s job?</span></h2><p><span>Natalie, as stated above, is a registered nurse. She is an emergency room nurse at Eisenhower Hospital in Rancho Mirage, California. During the COVID epidemic in April 2020, the Eisenhower Health nurse uploaded a selfie to Instagram with the caption:</span></p><p><span>“I never imagined I would work as an emergency nurse during a pandemic.” “These are definitely scary times,” Jenna Ortega’s mother commented on the photo. “Please be kind to each other and help flatten the curve.” Let’s help put an end to #covid19 by staying home.”</span></p><p><span>Natalie took another shot with her coworkers at the hospital the following month of the same year.</span></p><p><span>Natalie worked at Eisenhower Hospital before taking a medical trip to Haiti in 2010, where a devastating earthquake killed more than 200,000 people.</span></p><h2><span>Natalie Ortega, Jenna Ortega’s mother, where is she from?</span></h2><p><span>Natalie is from the United States, as stated above. Her grandmother immigrated to the United States from a small ranch near Sinaloa, Mexico, according to her family history.</span></p><h2><span>Who is Natalie Ortega’s son?</span></h2><p><span>Jenna Ortega, daughter of Natalie Ortega, is a renowned actress. Natalie’s daughter Jenna began her acting career as a child actress, gaining popularity with her role as Jane in the comedy-drama Jane the Virgin (2014-19).</span></p><p><span>In the years since, Ortega appeared in several more great television episodes, most notably her iconic performance in the Netflix horror comedy series Wednesday, for which she received Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations.</span></p><p><span>Jenna played Wednesday Addams alongside Gwendoline Christie, Riki Lindhome, Jamie McShane, Hunter Doohan and others on Wednesday.</span></p><h2><span>Is Natalie Ortega of Mexican origin?</span></h2><p><span>Natalie’s ancestors are Mexican and Puerto Rican, as her grandmother was born on a small ranch near Sinaloa, Mexico, while her father was born in Puerto Rico.</span></p><p><span>Natalie’s father moved to New York as a child with his family and then to California.</span></p><h2><span>Natalie Ortega, Jenna Ortega’s mother, is bilingual.</span></h2><p><span>Natalie is multilingual and speaks fluent English and Spanish. While she cared for her, her Mexican grandmother taught her Spanish. In fact, her grandmother arrived illegally to the United States from Mexico with her four daughters to offer them a better life.</span></p><p><span>She eventually sent all of her children to English-speaking schools, and they were only allowed to communicate with her in English to avoid attracting attention and avoid deportation.</span></p><p><span>Natalie, like her, wanted her children to be multilingual. However, it stopped working properly once Jenna’s father began having difficulty understanding what Natalie would say to her children in Spanish.</span></p><p><span>Jenna said of her father,</span></p><p><span>“His constant questioning was too much for her.” Now my family and I are working together to learn Spanish!</span></p><h2><span>Natalie Ortega and her spouse have a lovely marriage.</span></h2><p><span>Natalie has been married to Edward A. Ortega for several years. Edward, Natalie’s spouse, is a businessman. Jenna’s father, Edward, is 100% Mexican and his family immigrated to the United States years ago, settling in California.</span></p><p><span>Although Natalie’s spouse does not use social media, the trained nurse openly discusses her marriage to Edward on Instagram and Facebook.</span></p><p><span>Ortega congratulated her husband “Happy Father’s Day” on Instagram in June 2018 by posting a snapshot of him with their children. She said,</span></p><p><span>“Happy Father’s Day to my husband and all the other great dads out there.”</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, in July 2019, the husband and wife were seen having fun together in Paris, France.</span></p><p><span>So far, it seems like Natalie and her husband Edward are having a happy marriage.</span></p><h2><span>Natalie has six children, including her daughter Jenna.</span></h2><p><span>Yes, Natalie Ortega and her husband have six children, including Jenna Ortega. On January 1, 1998, the couple welcomed their first child, Isaac. Her oldest son, Isaac, attended Xavier College Prep before enrolling at Grand Canyon University. He later earned his bachelor’s degree from Arizona State University.</span></p><p><span>Isaac is currently a public accountant. He is also a married man, as he married Avery in August 2021. Natalie, his mother, congratulated him on Instagram with a beautiful snapshot of the couple.</span></p><p><span>Natalie’s second child, a daughter named Mariah, was born on January 25, 1999. Mia, her third child and second daughter, was born on May 15, 2000. In her hometown, she attended La Quinta High School. Mia was also a soccer player at that time.</span></p><p><span>Jenna, their popular daughter, was born on September 27, 2002. Ortega and her husband also welcomed twins Aaliyah and Markus.</span></p><p><span>The bubbly mother of six frequently posts about her children’s graduations, birthdays, and other special occasions on her social media accounts. Ortega warmly congratulated Ella star daughter Jenna Ella on her high school graduation with a 4.0 overall GPA in May 2020.</span></p><p><span>She started writing,</span></p><p><span>«Brains, talent and beauty, I am very lucky to be your mother.»</span></p><p><span>Extraordinary! It is not like this?</span></p><h2><span>Natalie is delighted to be Jenna Ortega’s mother: their relationship</span></h2><p><span>As previously stated, Natalie is thrilled to be the adoring mother of her famous daughter Jenna. And the nurse is also an important component of her enormous success as an actress. She was the one who shared the video of her daughter on her Facebook, which launched Jenna’s career.</span></p><p><span>Plus, if you follow Natalie on social media, you’ll notice how much she supports her daughter Jenna’s acting career. She posts all of her daughter’s work posts on Instagram. She also promotes her movies and television shows on social media.</span></p><p><span>Natalie frequently refers to her star daughter as Reeree. Ortega wished her birthday in September 2019 with the caption,</span></p><p><span>“Reeree, happy birthday!” “I adore you and I am very proud of you.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiilaO7onnOq6uen5FivaK%2BxKerrGWUnrOntcKuo61lk522rbDHqKadZZiewG65xLGgnJmeYq6vr8Ssq6uxXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjenna-ortega-parents-difficult-childhood-his-mexican-ancestry.html&text=Jenna%20Ortega%20Parents%2c%20difficult%20childhood%2c%20his%20Mexican%20ancestry&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjenna-ortega-parents-difficult-childhood-his-mexican-ancestry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjenna-ortega-parents-difficult-childhood-his-mexican-ancestry.html&title=Jenna%20Ortega%20Parents%2c%20difficult%20childhood%2c%20his%20Mexican%20ancestry" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjenna-ortega-parents-difficult-childhood-his-mexican-ancestry.html&title=Jenna%20Ortega%20Parents%2c%20difficult%20childhood%2c%20his%20Mexican%20ancestry" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjenna-ortega-parents-difficult-childhood-his-mexican-ancestry.html&title=Jenna%20Ortega%20Parents%2c%20difficult%20childhood%2c%20his%20Mexican%20ancestry" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjenna-ortega-parents-difficult-childhood-his-mexican-ancestry.html&description=Jenna%20Ortega%20Parents%2c%20difficult%20childhood%2c%20his%20Mexican%20ancestry" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./melania-trump-ex-bf-resurfaced-report.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Melania Trumps Ex-BF Details Who She Was Before US: Resurfaced Report">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./disney-dreamlight-valley-missing-gems-secret-chamber-puzzle.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Disney Dreamlight Valley Missing Gems in Secret Chamber Puzzle Great Blizzard">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
