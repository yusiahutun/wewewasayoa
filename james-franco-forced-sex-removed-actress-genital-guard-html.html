I want to talk about The Disaster Artist, which I loved, and want to get to the Golden Globes, but one of the things that happened at the Golden Globes - and obviously, this happened in the last couple of days before we had you booked on the show and I'm glad you're still here. You were wearing a time's up button like a lot of guys at the show and some women during your time on stage said that was hypocritical, they went to Twitter and said that it was hypocritical based on their experiences that they have had with you. They made some allegations. I wonder if you have read those tweets, and if so, how you respond to them?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>James Franco: Yes. I was sent a couple of the tweets, so yeah, I did read them. I haven't responded. I think, well the ones I read were not accurate, but one of the things that I've learned is that this is a conversation that obviously needs to be had. There are people, women and others who have not been a part of this conversation and I truly believe and why I was wearing the pin is that they need to be a part of this conversation and so I support that.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Seth: Ally Sheedy also had a tweet. She has since took it down. I heard you mention last night on Stephen Colbert's show that you had directed her in a play. You've had a good experience with her.

She took the tweet down, I don't know.

I - it was so shocking. I don't know. I just - I guess I'm just letting it be.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Seth: The last thing I'll say, or ask about this I should say, this moment, you know, I think this is an exciting time because it's allowing us all remember, especially as men, that there were other people in different perspectives for things that we experienced. Does this Times Up movement and this moment we're having right now, does it make you look back at all and question any of your behavior in the past based on this new perspective we're getting on how women have perceived things for so long?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>James: I think what I really learned and being here and this week and that show that we were you know ... I mean it was so powerful in there.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Seth: That we heard some amazing things from some amazing women.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>James: Like I said, there are stories that need to get out.&nbsp;There are people that need to be heard.
