<time>29 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>In the last four decades, at least sixteen people have portrayed the mysterious Michael Myers in the “Halloween” Franchise, including stuntmen, crew members, and actors.</strong></p><p>For most, Michael Meyers is a nightmare etched in their memory in the form of a mysterious white or sometimes grey mask. However, <a href=#>the man behind the mask</a> is as human as could be and has been played by numerous actors through decades.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Michael_Myers></span><strong>Who Is Michael Myers?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Michael Myers is the fictional psychotic villain in the American slasher franchise “Halloween.” The villainous character first graced the TV screens in 1978 on writer and producer John Carpenter’s original release of the film in 1978.</p><p>Since then, about eleven sequels have been released, with the upcoming “Halloween Ends” sated for a 2022 release being the twelfth sequel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Halloween-4_-The-Return-of-Michael-Myers-Publicity-still-of-George-P_-Wilbur.jpeg><p>Aside from “Halloween III: The Season Of The Witch,” which was a massive deviation from the franchise’s storyline, Michael has remained a constant in the slasher film for over four decades.</p><p>Yet, one could hardly pinpoint <a href=#>who exactly played Michael Meyers</a>, as several actors have taken the credits since the film’s release.</p><p>However, the franchise seems to have made actor Tony Moran the official face of Michael Myers, as he portrayed the character the few times we see him unmasked.</p><p>Besides Moran, which other actors have donned the mask, and snagged the privilege of scaring viewers as the mystery boogeyman?</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=1_Nick_Castle></span><strong>1.

He has credits for writing “Escape From New York,” and directing “Mr. Wrong,” “Dennis The Menace,” and “Major Payne.” He has been married to Charlene Nelson since 1981 and they have a son, Louis Castle.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=2_Tony_Moran></span><strong>2.

However, those three seconds where Laurie Strode briefly unmasked Michael to reveal Moran’s face made him the ultimate star of the show.</p><p>He retired from acting after that and made a career hosting weddings as Michael Meyers among other gigs. He returned to the big screen in 2008 with the short film, “Lucky Break,” and has landed a few other roles since then.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=3_Will_Sandin></span><strong>3.

He has since grown into a 52-year-old man and resides in Los Angeles.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=4_Dick_Warlock></span><strong>4.

Hence, they introduced “Halloween 4: The Return Of Michael Myers” with George P. Wilbur as the leading antagonist.</p><p>Sharing the iconic role with Tom Morga and Erik Preston in the reboot, he played the majority of the parts, while his counterparts took a few scenes.</p><p>Notably, Preston played the young Michael in flashbacks while Morga donned the mask in the opening ambulance sequence, the diner with Dr. Loomis, and the gas station.</p><p>He spent the rest of his career working as a stuntman and was inducted into the Hollywood Stuntmen’s Hall of Fame.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=6_Don_Shanks></span><strong>6.

Michael Lerner</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The next installment of the franchise was titled “Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers,” and saw Wilbur return as the villainous character for most of the film.</p><p>However, the test audience disapproved of the movie, forcing the producers to swing into action urgently and reshoot most scenes.</p><p>This time, they enlisted the service of Michael Lerner in Wilbur’s stead, to depict a less-bulky Michael Myers. Observant viewers would notice this change, which ended up seeming more like a continuity error.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=8_Chris_Durand></span><strong>8.

When the franchise introduced another sequel, “Halloween H20: 20 Years Later,” the aging effect was depicted in the greying mask, looking worn out from age.</p><p>Behind the mask, actor Chris Durand remained as agile as ever, making Michael Meyers as threatening as his 21-year-old self.</p><p>He continued working as a stuntman following that role, with credits in “Westworld,” and the Marvel franchise.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=9_Brad_Loree></span><strong>9.

He also made brief appearances in “Halloween Kills.”</p><p>The actor has since appeared in a handful of hit movies and television shows, including “Far and Away,” “When A Man Loves A Woman,” “Babylon 5,” and “Buffy The Vampire Slayer.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=12_Airon_Armstrong></span><strong>12.

He also has credits in “The Dark Knight Rises,” and “Noah.”</p><p>With all these actors coming together through the years to bring the mysterious boogeyman to life, it’s hard to decide which actor played it best.</p><p>However, answering the question of “which Michael Myers is the scariest?” seems less evasive, as, in the end, the character’s fury and intensity are only depicted by the mask.</p><p>After all, he remains a faceless villain for most of the film and none of the subsequent representations beats the original’s remodeled Captain Kirk’s mask.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jKmjmrGVmXqutcKhmJ6kXaLGpr7SZp%2BapJykxKaxzWacr52irnqir9OoqWasmJp6tLTAqZxmq5yWwKmx0WadoqSdZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-played-michael-myers-halloween-every-actor-the-shape-slasher-film.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-played-michael-myers-halloween-every-actor-the-shape-slasher-film.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-played-michael-myers-halloween-every-actor-the-shape-slasher-film.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-played-michael-myers-halloween-every-actor-the-shape-slasher-film.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-played-michael-myers-halloween-every-actor-the-shape-slasher-film.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-played-michael-myers-halloween-every-actor-the-shape-slasher-film.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./natalie-cole-son-robert-yancy-dead.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./natalie-cole-son-robert-yancy-dead.html>Natalie Cole's Son Dead at 39</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./0-4bdhyhu6.html>Eric Bellinger Walks His Goats Down Rodeo Drive</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./0-4bdhyhu6.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
