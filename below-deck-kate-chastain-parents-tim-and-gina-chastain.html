Proud to be a mother for the first time, 39-year-old Kate did not take long to show the world a picture of her newborn Sullivan Cay, who appeared to be smirking at the camera.</p><p style=text-align:left>So, while Kate’s news meets with congratulations from fans and from across the Bravo universe, let us introduce to you her parents who also have been absolutely thrilled to become grandparents.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Below Deck: Who Are Kate Chastain’s Parents?</strong></h3><p>Kate Chastain has drawn attention to herself and those closest to her since joining Below Deck in its second season in August 2014. She was a staple of the series for six seasons before retiring in February 2020. Afterward, she went on to executive produce and host Bravo’s Chat Room, which is a regular on the network’s series Below Deck Galley Talk. Later, she also was&nbsp;one of the contestants on Peacock’s reality competition series, The Traitors.</p><p>So, naturally, Kate’s growing fans over the years have been always wanting to know about her parents.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Meet Tim Chastain, Kate Chastain’s Father</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Kate Chastain’s father, Herman Timothy Chastain was also simply known as Tim Chastain. He passed away in April 2023, days before he got to be 68 on April 26th.</p><p>Kate is really fond of her dad and he also was of her. Often on his social media posts, Kate’s dad kept on gushing about how he was so very proud of his “all grown up” “Katie Baby”. He always teasingly whined that she grew so fast. The patriarch had always been his daughter’s no.1 cheerleader. Back in December 2016, we saw him promote her first book “Lucky CHARMING”.</p><p>Late Tim was on ‘Tim Chastain’ <a href=#>Facebook</a>. “Checkered past. Has been said I am an interesting character. I am still trying to get it right”, this is what his BIO read on Facebook.</p><p>Speaking of his career, the late Tim was the owner of Chastain’s Landing and owner/guide at Fin Expeditions. Also, previously, he had a job at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. In a local paper news article from back in 2013, Tim was described as a hotel tycoon, a city commissioner, a NASA scientist, a businessman, and a coastal engineer.</p><p>As a guide, Tim got good, even great, reviews on&nbsp;Tripadvisor also.</p><p>After he died, many of his friends remembered him in their own way. One particularly, said he was a fun, private, compassionate, and eccentric kind of man. They also shared how his mom was more than loving (unlike his stepdad) but died too young leaving young boys to deal with loss.</p><p>Tim also is survived by his brother Stephen Chastain and sister-in-law Dee Shaffer Chastain of Jacksonville, Florida.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Meet Gina Chastain, Kate Chastain’s Mother</strong></h3><p>At the time of this writing, it was not understood if Gina (Mariani) Chastin is Kate Chastain’s biological mother. Because Kate only followed Tim on her Facebook and not Gina.</p><p style=text-align:left>Gina turned 63 years old in April 2023. As per&nbsp;her <a href=#>Facebook</a>, she worked at Advantec College and studied Nursing at the University of Phoenix (Class of 2009), and at Brevard Community College (Class of 1996). Even prior, she went to Cocoa Beach High School.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>Are Kate Chastain’s Parents Related To Jessica Chastain?</strong></h4></li></ul><p style=text-align:left>Kate Chastain’s parents are not related to Jessica Chastain, the renowned actress who recently received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for starring in a 2023 Broadway revival of A Doll’s House.</p><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>How Many Kids Did Kate Chastain’s Parents Have?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Thus far, it was not known if Kate Chastain is the only child of her parents.

Per her BIO on Bravo, she has jumped ship and retired from yachtie life after six seasons as a star and fan favorite on the show.</p><p>The Florida native other than expanding her impressive career over international waters and being a Bravo household name, is a celebrated author, philanthropist, podcaster, radio show host, dog mom, and now a human mom also.</p><p>She began her yachting career in 2007. It all started with her “only taking a gap year” after college graduation to work on boats. But, once she was on it, that was all she wanted to do. Her journey on water began with her working as a third stewardess. After that, while traveling throughout the Caribbean, Mediterranean, Central America, and New England, Kate worked her way up the ranks and finally attained the position of Chief Stewardess.</p><p>Kate is also known to have entertained royalty, celebrities, and business tycoons around the world.</p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmm52cpMRusMScomajkamybq%2FHmqqtmZmjerGt0Z6lratdqbauecCnm2afmaOubq%2FHmqqtmZmjfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbelow-deck-kate-chastain-parents-tim-and-gina-chastain.html&text=Below%20Deck%3a%20Who%20Are%20Kate%20Chastain%20Parents%3a%20Tim%2c%20Gina%20Chastain%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbelow-deck-kate-chastain-parents-tim-and-gina-chastain.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbelow-deck-kate-chastain-parents-tim-and-gina-chastain.html&title=Below%20Deck%3a%20Who%20Are%20Kate%20Chastain%20Parents%3a%20Tim%2c%20Gina%20Chastain%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbelow-deck-kate-chastain-parents-tim-and-gina-chastain.html&title=Below%20Deck%3a%20Who%20Are%20Kate%20Chastain%20Parents%3a%20Tim%2c%20Gina%20Chastain%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbelow-deck-kate-chastain-parents-tim-and-gina-chastain.html&title=Below%20Deck%3a%20Who%20Are%20Kate%20Chastain%20Parents%3a%20Tim%2c%20Gina%20Chastain%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbelow-deck-kate-chastain-parents-tim-and-gina-chastain.html&description=Below%20Deck%3a%20Who%20Are%20Kate%20Chastain%20Parents%3a%20Tim%2c%20Gina%20Chastain%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./best-minecraft-bedrock-servers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Best Minecraft Bedrock Servers (June 2024 )">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./cw-releases-character-posters-supernaturals-wayward-sisters-backdoor-pilot.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The CW Releases Character Posters For Supernaturals Wayward Sisters Backdoor Pilot">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
