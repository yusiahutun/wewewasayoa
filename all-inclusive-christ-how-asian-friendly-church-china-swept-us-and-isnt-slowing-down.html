Today, living in the San Gabriel Valley, east of Los Angeles, with his wife and daughter, he is working on his PhD dissertation in systematic theology at Fuller.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">The Christian converts in Ming-dynasty China who made the religion respectable</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chen is also now a minister at “The Church” in Franklin, New Jersey, affiliated not with the denominational Christian churches he was first exposed to all those years ago, but with the Local Churches, a movement that can be traced back more than a century, to a man in China, named Watchman Nee.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While most Protestant movements branch out of European tradition, Nee’s “Local Churches” in China had a uniquely local flavour, and now boast congregations in Britain, India, Japan, Lebanon, New Zealand and Nigeria, with more than 300 in the United States and Canada alone.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think one of the reasons [the Local Churches’] ideas have caught on in so many countries is that they offered a de-Westernised version of Christianity,” says Paul Chang, an assistant professor of Global Christianity at the University of California.</p>There was no pulpit, and [Watchman Nee] made those around him feel that he was listening and not judgingJennifer Lin, author and a descendant of Nee<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Born and raised in California, 41-year-old Chang has studied Nee’s ideas for decades – “a form of Christianity that cut out a lot of the European and North American cultural influences”, he explains. “Their message also proved attractive because of its emphasis on the human spirit, as a potential place in each person to find a transcendent union with God.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Born on November 4, 1903 as Ni Shu-tsu, Watchman Nee rose from humble beginnings to become an unlikely spiritual giant. Known also as Ni Tuosheng, or Nee T’o-sheng, Watchman spent much of his formative years in Fuzhou, Fujian province, where he attended the Church Missionary Society (CMS) Vernacular School and received a Western education.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Watchman Nee’s speaking style was gentle,” writes Jennifer Lin in her book Shanghai Faithful: Betrayal and Forgiveness in a Chinese Christian Family (2017).

Written works by Nee are often circulated at such assemblies.)</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 1942, Nee opened the China Biological and Chemical Laboratories with his brother, who was a research chemist.

During his visit, Lee brought up the need for a branch in Taiwan, which was experiencing a swell in Christianity as believers fled the unfriendly Communist regime.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That is when Nee decided his Gospel Book Room would expand: the main branch in Shanghai, one in Taipei and one in Hong Kong, each to be managed by different members to avoid the risk of being shut down in a single raid.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shanghai would remain under the direction of Nee while Lee was charged with overseeing operations in Taipei, to “ensure that the things delivered to them by the Lord would not be lost” – and instructed to continue publishing Nee’s works outside the Communist Party’s reach and distribute the material from Taipei to the rest of the world.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Hong Kong operation was run by another disciple of Nee, Weigh Kwang-hsi.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/19/72a767cf-120a-4849-afa5-5b34a27d4a2f_ade5f04c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Chang, neither Nee nor Lee ever publicly condemned the Communist Party, but Nee was arrested in 1952 and sentenced to 15 years for tax evasion and corrupt business practices, as Mao Zedong’s administration began rounding up religious leaders and intellectuals into prisons, or distant farming fields.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When Watchman Nee was imprisoned in 1952, there were upwards of 700 Local Churches with 80,000 members in China,” says Isaac Hsu, who works with the Local Churches in California. “Today there are thousands of Local Churches with at least a million members in China, and over 10 million [worshippers] in house churches who appreciate Watchman Nee’s ministry.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To his followers, Nee represents a Protestant fight for the Chinese soul. But unlike Martin Luther, who was excommunicated by the Catholic Church, Nee faced the wrath of Communist China. He died in prison for his faith, and believers in China and beyond still take encouragement from his example.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The story goes that the prison guard who found him dead on May 30, 1972, had no knowledge of Christianity and gave the family what he believed was a suicide note. The scrap of paper read: “Christ is the son of God. He died as the redeemer for human beings and was raised from the dead after three days. This is the biggest thing in the universe. I shall die for believing in Christ.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During Nee’s incarceration, Lee continued to grow the church in Taiwan, building it up from a mere 350 believers to 20,000 in five years, according to Lee’s website.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/19/6d063d0c-5979-4cb2-a8fe-95ac32ff346a_b3ee84ec.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 1962, Lee felt called to the US to expand the ministry. He had visited the country previously, and felt that he could entrust his work in East Asia to the people he had trained. Lee settled in California as the Chinese population there boomed, and he remained active in the church until 1997 – the year when Michael Chen began attending services.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Lee came to carry out Watchman Nee’s ministry and God’s commission not only in the USA but also to the whole Earth,” says Chen. “He settled in California due to the reception of his ministry among the Christians. ‘The All-Inclusive Christ’ is the first conference Witness Lee gave in the United States, in 1962 in Los Angeles.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In every Local Churches outpost (known as lampstands) members evangelise to their community, much in the way Chen was brought into the fold in 1997.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Today, Nee and Lee’s publishing legacy is carried on by Living Stream Ministry (LSM), a non-profit organisation based in Anaheim, California, that brands itself as a Levitical service.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Its Recovery Version of the Bible, used in Local Churches, was first published in 1991, with footnotes by Lee, and revised in 2003 and 2016. (There is also an app made by LSM for iOS and Android.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/19/b14b9d18-76b2-40dc-844c-0ce0a1e83902_b20bcac7.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee was no stranger to criticism in his time, and his teachings have consistently come into question by counter-cult organisations such as the Christian Research Institute (CRI) and the Spiritual Counterfeits Project, especially on the topics of the nature of God, the nature of man, God’s full salvation and the Church.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 1976, Bible publisher Thomas Nelson commissioned two books, The God-Men and The Mindbenders, that both dealt in part with the teachings of the Local Churches. Both works accused the Churches of authoritarianism, thought reform, isolating members, deceptive recruiting, financial malfeasance and the use of fear and humiliation to control members.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Local Churches sued many detractors that followed, using church branches and members to bring multiple cases against their foes. Some disputes have been settled out of court, but, much as with other hyper-litigious religious organisations, most opponents avoid getting on the Churches’ bad side.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">CRI, for example, has retracted statements describing the group as “cult-like”. Meanwhile, Harvest House, publisher of the Encyclopedia of Cults and New Religions, which features a section on the Local Churches, won its court case and, according to its website, “did not retreat or settle”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Christianity Today, a magazine founded by superstar American evangelist Billy Graham, wrote in a March 2006 editorial that “one by one, and in their own words, representatives of the local churches testified to their belief in one God, revealed in three persons who are eternally distinct; to the reality that human beings can never ontologically attain Godhood; and to the fact that they were ‘only the church’ as opposed to being ‘the only church’.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/19/c41262f2-9d12-4f40-9b05-05f5a752f34e_0beb150c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A few years after the death of Mao, China began to reopen to international trade and travel. Similar to what the Soviets would soon experience with glasnost – increased openness and transparency in government institutions and activities – a “post-80s generation” in China experienced an almost unrecognisable country.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The Local Church’s members in Hong Kong, Taiwan and California were among the first Protestant groups to return [to post-Mao China] and reconnect with mainland Christian communities,” says Joseph Tse-hei Lee, director of the Global Asia Institute at Pace University, in New York.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee has written a paper on martyrdom in Chinese Protestant Christianity. “Dying for Faith, Transforming Memories: Chinese Christian Martyr Watchman Nee”, was published in the Macau Ricci Institute Journal in September 2020.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Nee’s tragic story recasts the church-state conflict as a spiritual and moral struggle, healing the emotional wounds of persecuted Christians and inspiring them to defend their faith,” Lee says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Michael Chen, who returns to China at least once a year to visit family, and whose name has been changed here to protect his identity, says he does not fear persecution for his faith.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/19/9add7fd7-0e14-4bd6-883b-033d99f7953b_420b4dce.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I did not know any Christians or hear any gospel while I was in China,” recalls Chen. “It was not until I became a Christian through the believers in the Local Churches that I began to read Watchman Nee and Witness Lee. What attracted me most was the loving atmosphere in their family life and church life.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Soon I was baptised and have been enjoying the Lord, the church life, and pursuing God’s word through the help of the ministry of Watchman Nee and Witness Lee.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Thanks to the community of about 15,000 believers Stateside in the ’90s, Chen was able to connect to people with similar backgrounds in a foreign land and, whether it’s California or New Jersey, the Local Churches have built up a network that continually sends representatives into the world around them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are estimated to be between 500,000 and 2 million members connected to the movement worldwide.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In places such as Monterey Park [a city in the San Gabriel Valley, California], where many new Chinese immigrants find it easy to settle in, our churches have been active in preaching the gospel,” says Chen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And they continue to make campus ministries a priority, proselytising to students all over the US. In southern California, the Local Churches are recruiting students – both international and domestic – at more than 150 institutions. They do so by outreach efforts such as Friday night home meetings for students and young adults – just as Chen attended services after members bought him food back in 1997.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Before I became a Christian, I felt lonely as a stranger and alien to this country,” says Chen. “Yet after I became a Christian and began to meet with the believers in the Local Churches, I received much spiritual shepherding and genuine care like in a real family and, in a sense, much more than in my own family.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOpaann12nsqKw0miYq6yZmLmme5JrZ3BrZml8orjLZqCnm5yqwKrCxGaaoaqZqMFutM6wZJqrmZa7brLRopynnJyueqS01KuaoWWTnbavrYysrp6opGLCtHnAp5tmoaOjwW6%2Fy6iuoqaXYrGww80%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fall-inclusive-christ-how-asian-friendly-church-china-swept-us-and-isnt-slowing-down.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fall-inclusive-christ-how-asian-friendly-church-china-swept-us-and-isnt-slowing-down.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fall-inclusive-christ-how-asian-friendly-church-china-swept-us-and-isnt-slowing-down.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fall-inclusive-christ-how-asian-friendly-church-china-swept-us-and-isnt-slowing-down.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fall-inclusive-christ-how-asian-friendly-church-china-swept-us-and-isnt-slowing-down.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fall-inclusive-christ-how-asian-friendly-church-china-swept-us-and-isnt-slowing-down.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./harry-lloyd-and-gugu-mbatha-raw.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./harry-lloyd-and-gugu-mbatha-raw.html>Harry Lloyd and Gugu Mbatha-Raw</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./breaking-bad-explosive-death-scene-started-as-a-joke-html.html>This 1 Explosive Death Scene Started as a Joke</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./breaking-bad-explosive-death-scene-started-as-a-joke-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
