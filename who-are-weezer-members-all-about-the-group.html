The band’s name, “Weezer,” was actually his childhood nickname.</span></p><p><span>Beyond his brilliant work with the band, Rivers Cuomo has also recorded several albums as a solo artist, including&nbsp;</span><span>Alone: ​​The Rivers Cuomo Home Recordings</span><span>&nbsp;(2007),&nbsp;</span><span>Alone II: The Rivers Cuomo Home Recordings</span><span>&nbsp;(2008) and&nbsp;</span><span>Alone III: The Pinkerton Years</span><span>&nbsp;(2011).&nbsp;He also released an EP&nbsp;</span><span>Cuomo and Friends: Living by Fingerprints</span><span>&nbsp;in 2009.
