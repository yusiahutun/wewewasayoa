He grew up on a dairy farm in a large family along with five other siblings, where he was the youngest;&nbsp;2 brothers and 3 sisters.&nbsp;Having grown up in the countryside among animals, he always liked animals.</span></p><p><strong><span>Subtítulo</span></strong><span>&nbsp;: A young Dr. Pol with his wife.</span><br><strong><span>Source</span></strong><span>&nbsp;:&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"><span>pinterest.com</span></a></p><p><span>Growing up, Jan wanted to go into farming like the rest of his family.&nbsp;However, at the age of 12, he had the opportunity to help a vet deliver a litter of piglets and it turned out to be a life-changing moment for him.&nbsp;Dr. Pol then wanted to pursue the life of a veterinarian.&nbsp;Jan studied veterinary medicine at Utrecht University and later graduated with a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) degree.</span></p><p><span>He has had an amazing career and has accomplished a lot as a veterinarian.&nbsp;He is currently the owner of ‘Pol Veterinary Services’ and has a team of specialists who help him.&nbsp;His clinic in Weidman, Michigan has been able to provide many different services to more than 19,000 clients.&nbsp;To begin with, Jan began providing services for large animals such as horses, cattle, and sheep.&nbsp;But later, with more experience, he began to take care of the little ones as well.</span></p><p><span>Dr. Pol is well known and is considered a familiar figure in his field.&nbsp;Jan is a hardworking man and even at 75, he works to make sure the cattle are healthy.</span></p><h2><span>Dr. Pol: Personal Life</span></h2><p><span>Dr. Jan Pol has been married to his wife Daine Pol for over 50 years.&nbsp;It’s a feat in itself to have a long-term committed relationship like them.&nbsp;The couple still have the same love, mutual understanding and spark between them.</span></p><p><span>These two met in 1961 when Jan was on a foreign exchange program at Mayville High School.&nbsp;She spent a year of high school in Michigan to be closer to her sister who had moved to Canada.&nbsp;In Michigan, she was taken in by a family and Diane was the daughter of that family.</span></p><p><span>When Pol returned to the Netherlands, he still tried to stay in touch with Diane through letters.&nbsp;In one of his letters Pol invited Diane to visit him and this laid a solid foundation for their relationship.</span></p><p><span>Later in 1967, Pol married Diane in a small wedding ceremony.&nbsp;After taking their wedding vows, they returned to the Netherlands as Dr. Pol had yet to complete his education;&nbsp;Pol graduated in 1970.</span></p><p><span>Dr. Pol and Diane continue to be an inspiring couple for many.&nbsp;The story of how they met and the fact that they are still together is a perfect story.&nbsp;The two currently work together for Jan’s veterinary service. They have been married for over 50 years but have no children of their own.&nbsp;The kind couple decided to adopt and give a home to three children, a son and two daughters.</span></p><h2><span>Dr. Pol: Net Worth</span></h2><p><span>Today, Dr. Pol, who gained fame through Nat Geo, is a reality star.&nbsp;Charles, the son of The Incredible Dr. Pol, is also an actor and producer;&nbsp;he was the one who had the idea to turn Dr. Pol’s veterinary business into a television show.&nbsp;When it started, Dr. Pol did not expect the show to make it past the first season, now to his surprise it is currently in its twelfth season.</span></p><p><span>Pol is part of the cast of the program and also the owner of a “Pol veterinary service”.&nbsp;It is believed that he accumulated a huge sum.&nbsp;According to estimates, his net worth is believed to be around one million dollars.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3>Advertisement <a class=close-stky-ads onclick='if(!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers)return!1;document.getElementById("bl_banner").style.display="none"' data-cf-modified-8216579b9bcd2458f380e90f- href=#></a><p>Copyright © 2024.
