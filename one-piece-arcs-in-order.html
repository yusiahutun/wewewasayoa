Surely no more than 500, right?" Try well over a thousand episodes of content and counting, as the series is still providing new episodes to this very day. Watching the epic tale of Monkey D. Luffy (<strong>Mayumi Tanaka</strong>) and his crew of pirates unfold is about as tricky as finding the fictional treasure they're looking for (which they still haven't found, by the way). Regardless, while the anime series has always had its fans, there has been renewed interest following the buzz around <a href=#>Netflix's big-budget live-action adaptation</a>, which at $18 million per episode, is one of the most expensive shows ever made. The live-action series has since become known as an outlier of anime adaptations, and it's massive surge in popularity has also generated more interest in the original anime.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/yamato-one-piece.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="'One Piece' Fan-Favorite Yamato Finds Actor for English Dub">'One Piece' Fan-Favorite Yamato Finds Actor for English Dub</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Crunchyroll is set to debut new dubbed episodes soon.</p><p>Though this may seem like a frivolous task to some, we here at Collider never shy away from a challenge.

We quickly meet our main protagonist of, Monkey D. Luffy - a naive young man who wants to be King of the Pirates and find the elusive One Piece treasure. Oh, and he also ate an artifact known as a "Devil Fruit," allowing Luffy to stretch his body miraculously. An aspiring captain in need of a crew, Luffy spends this first trilogy trying to recruit Roronoa Zoro (<strong>Kazuya Nakai</strong>) - a skilled pirate hunter with a unique dueling style.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=orange-town-arc-episodes-4-8>Orange Town Arc (Episodes 4-8)</h3><p>After convincing Zoro to join him, Luffy sets sail for Orange Town in search of a navigator. Upon arrival, they see the town has been taken over by the insane clown pirate, Captain Buggy (<strong>Shigeru Chiba</strong>). Luffy finds a navigator for his crew in Nami (<strong>Akemi Okamura</strong>) - a master thief obsessed with building her wealth and finding treasure.</p><h3 id=syrup-village-arc-episodes-9-18>Syrup Village Arc (Episodes 9-18)</h3><p>The next member of Luffy's crew becomes a liar with a heart of gold named Usopp (<strong>Kappei Yamaguchi</strong>). Though Usopp lacks any piracy experience, his determination to help expose a butler masquerading as a deadly pirate proves him a worthy ally for Luffy's team. Plus, their helping of Usopp leads to the crew finally getting their bona fide ship.</p><h3 id=baratie-arc-episodes-19-30>Baratie Arc (Episodes 19-30)</h3><p>Named after a floating restaurant, the Baratie Arc sees Luffy and the crew gain one more member before setting off for "The Grand Line" - the legendary location where the One Piece treasure is believed to be. Knowing they'll need food for this journey, they find a cook in Sanji (<strong>Hiroaki Hirata</strong>) - a cool-as-ice sous-chef who falls head over heels in love with Nami.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=arlong-arc-episodes-31-44>Arlong Arc (Episodes 31-44)</h3><p>After getting separated from Nami during the events during the Baratie Arc, the protagonist find she has been recruited by the Arlong - a dreaded fish-human hybrid with a thirst for violence. Ultimately, Nami is rescued, and the Straw Hat crew is officially formed.</p><h3 id=loguetown-arc-episodes-45-and-48-53>Loguetown Arc (Episodes 45 and 48-53)</h3><p>Now with enough crew members to begin this quest properly, the Straw Hat crew is ready to make their way to the grand line. Before embarking on that multi-year quest, they head to where Gold Roger (<strong>Chikao Ôtsuka</strong>), the Pirate King who hid the One Piece treasure, was born and died. Unfortunately for the heroes, they're in for quite a surprise when Captain Buggy catches up to them, hell-bent on revenge for his humiliation in Orange Town.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=buggy-39-s-crew-adventure-chronicles-arc-episodes-46-47>Buggy's Crew Adventure Chronicles Arc (Episodes 46-47)</h3><p>In a change of pace for the East Blue Saga, One Piece takes a few episodes to explore what Buggy and his crew got up to following Orange Town and how they got to Loguetown to face Luffy again.</p><h3 id=warship-island-arc-episodes-54-61-filler>Warship Island Arc (Episodes 54-61) *Filler*</h3><p>Some arcs in the One Piece series are not based on the original Manga and are made only for the series. The Warship Island arc is one of those storylines, showing Luffy and his crew helping an endangered sea serpent called a Sennenryu. Filler arcs like this are still enjoyable watches, but can ultimately be skipped in favor of the main content.</p><h2 id=arabasta-saga>Arabasta Saga</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screen-shot-2023-07-16-at-1-48-32-pm.jpg><h3 id=reverse-mountain-arc-episodes-62-63>Reverse Mountain Arc (Episodes 62-63)</h3><p>The arc that star of the Arabasta Saga is even shorter than the Romance Dawn Arc, being only two episodes long. It's significant, though as the Reverse Mountain is the treacherous entryway into the Grand Line. Not only do the Straw Hats meet a fearsome giant whale, but they also see that they have a duo of bounty hunters on their tale.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=whiskey-peak-arc-episodes-64-67>Whiskey Peak Arc (Episodes 64-67)</h3><p>After passing the Reverse Mountain and gaining a Log Pose (a compass-like device to help navigate the Grand Line), the Straw Hat crew arrive at Whiskey Peak. The island seems to be home to the Tortuga of the One Piece universe, functioning as a safe haven for pirates. That's how it appears on the surface, but there's much more to the mysterious island.</p><h3 id=diary-of-koby-meppo-arc-episodes-68-69>Diary of Koby-Meppo Arc (Episodes 68-69)</h3><p>The following two episodes reunite audiences with Helmeppo (<strong>Kôichi Nagano</strong>) and Koby (<strong>Mika Doi</strong>) - two minor characters who appeared back in the Romance Dawn arc. The Diary depicts the two polar opposite personalities as they train to become noble Marines.</p><h3 id=little-garden-arc-episodes-70-77>Little Garden Arc (Episodes 70-77)</h3><p>Circling back to Luffy and the Straw Hat crew, their next stop in the Grand Line is an island home to two giants locked in combat. They also have a proper battle with the hunters tracking them, known as Baroque Works, who seek to collect the hefty bounty on Luffy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=drum-island-arc-episodes-78-91>Drum Island Arc (Episodes 78-91)</h3><p>The Drum Island Arc adds the first new crew member to the Straw Hats for the first time since the Baratie Arc, and its the strangest addition yet. When Nami gets sick, the Straw Hats desperately search for someone to heal her. They find one in a talking, anthropomorphic reindeer of all things named Tony Tony Chopper (<strong>Ikue Ôtani</strong>).</p><h3 id=arabasta-arc-episodes-92-130>Arabasta Arc (Episodes 92-130)</h3><p>Yes, it's confusing that there is an arc called the Arabasta Arc inside the Arabasta Saga, but that's only because this is the most significant arc. This comes after the Straw Hats learn that Baroque Works is seeking insight into a war in the province of Arabasta, with the puppet master of this act of warmongering being led by the mysterious Mr. 0 (<strong>Ryûzaburô Ôtomo</strong>). The Straw Hats also get another crew member in, archaeologist Nico Robin (<strong>Yuriko Yamaguchi</strong>).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=post-arabasta-arc-episodes-131-135-filler>Post-Arabasta Arc (Episodes 131-135) *Filler*</h3><p>Another filler arc that can be skipped, the Post-Arabasta arc largely centers on some solo anthology stories of most of the Straw Hat crew.</p><h2 id=sky-island-saga>Sky Island Saga</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screen-shot-2023-07-16-at-1-49-24-pm.jpg><h3 id=goat-island-arc-episodes-136-138-filler>Goat Island Arc (Episodes 136-138) *Filler*</h3><p>The Sky Island Saga begins with...another filler arc. This one sees Luffy and his crew meet a goat guy. Okay.</p><h3 id=ruluka-island-arc-episodes-139-143-filler>Ruluka Island Arc (Episodes 139-143) *Filler*</h3><p>Oh, for the love of- another filler arc? Come on, let's get back to the stories that matter! Basically, all you need to know is that the Marines are hunting the now-infamous Straw Hats.</p><h3 id=jaya-arc-episodes-144-152>Jaya Arc (Episodes 144-152)</h3><p>That's more like it. The Jaya Arc finally starts the Sky Island Saga properly. When Luffy and the Straw Hats are confused by the Log Pose's directions (which seem to be pointing up), they discover the answer is the compass is leading them to a island floating in the sky. The Straw Hats meet new friends, new enemies, and even <strong>Blackbeard</strong> (<strong>Akio Otsuka</strong>) himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=skypiea-arc-episodes-153-195>Skypiea Arc (Episodes 153-195)</h3><p>Luffy and his crew discover the location and method of reaching the Sky Island rather quickly. Much like Arabasta, the island is in a war-torn state, all being orchestrated by a malevolent madman who claims to be a god, going by Enel (<strong>Toshiyujji Morikawa</strong>).</p><h3 id=g-8-arc-episodes-196-206-filler>G-8 Arc (Episodes 196-206) *Filler*</h3><p>While technically another filler arc, the G-8 Arc at least functions as an epilogue to the Skypiea Arc. After Luffy and the crew crash-land on the Earth, they find themselves in the custody of the Marines in their base and desperately need an escape.</p><h2 id=water-7-saga>Water 7 Saga</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screen-shot-2023-07-16-at-1-50-40-pm.jpg><h3 id=long-ring-long-land-arc-episodes-207-219>Long Ring Long Land Arc (Episodes 207-219)</h3><p>The next saga begins with some of the Straw Hats most troublesome foes yet, the aptly named Foxy Pirates. Now that the Straw Hats are recognized pirates, they are challenged to participate in a Davy Back Fight. If they lose this historic challenge, Luffy may lose some of his trusted crew mates.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=ocean-39-s-dream-arc-episodes-220-224-filler>Ocean's Dream Arc (Episodes 220-224) *Filler*</h3><p>Another filler arc, but an interesting one since it's based on one of the One Piece video games.</p><h3 id=foxy-39-s-return-arc-episodes-225-228>Foxy's Return Arc (Episodes 225-228)</h3><p>After being an enemy in the Long Ring Long Land Arc, Captain Foxy (<strong>Bin Shimada</strong>) returns as a begrudging ally in Foxy's Return. The Straw Hat's assist him in reclaiming his stolen ship.</p><h3 id=water-7-arc-episodes-229-263>Water 7 Arc (Episodes 229-263)</h3><p>The Staw Hats' signature ship, the Going Merry, is badly damaged at the start of the Water 7 Arc. It needs repairs immediately, and the province of Water 7 may have just what they're looking for. They even find someone who will eventually be a personal shipwright for the crew in crime lord Franky (<strong>Kazuki Yao</strong>), though that won't happen until a later arc. Until then, the rest of the Straw Hat crew begin to become at odds with each other, and one member even goes missing.</p><h3 id=enies-lobby-arc-episodes-264-290-293-302-and-304-312>Enies Lobby Arc (Episodes 264-290, 293-302, and 304-312)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/one-piece-nico-robin.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That crew member who went missing was Robin, who, along with Franky, was kidnapped and taken to the isle of Enies Lobby. The culprit behind this is the World Government. As their title implies, they are the "Evil Empire" of the One Piece universe and are essentially the franchise's overarching antagonists. The aftermath officially makes Luffy public enemy number one to the nefarious regime.</p><h3 id=boss-luffy-historical-special-arc-episodes-291-292-303-and-406-407>Boss Luffy Historical Special Arc (Episodes 291-292, 303, and 406-407)</h3><p>A standalone, non-canon adventure, the Boss Luffy Historical Special Arc is set in an alternate universe where Luffy and his companions exist in a Feudal Japan-inspired world.</p><h3 id=post-enies-lobby-arc-episodes-313-325>Post-Enies Lobby Arc (Episodes 313-325)</h3><p>The epilogue to the Enies Lobby Arc sees Franky indebted to the Straw Hat crew for saving his life. Not only does he repair the Going Merry, but he also officially joins the crew. Meanwhile, Luffy has a surprising reunion with Helmeppo, Kody, and his own grandfather, Monkey D. Garp (<strong>Hiroshi Naka</strong>).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=thriller-bark-saga>Thriller Bark Saga</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/one-piece-thriller-bark.jpg><h3 id=ice-hunter-arc-episodes-326-335-filler>Ice Hunter Arc (Episodes 326-335) *Filler*</h3><p>Thriller Bark is one of the show's shortest sagas, and it begins with another filler arc in the Ice Hunter Arc. This essentially shows how Luffy and his crew get to the Florian Triangle - a hazardous part of the ocean.</p><h3 id=chopper-man-special-episode-336-filler>Chopper Man Special (Episode 336) *Filler*</h3><p>Another standalone story, the Chopper Man Special, tells another alternate storyline about Tony Tony Chopper, who becomes a superhero and gets the spotlight as a crime-fighting vigilante.</p><h3 id=thriller-bark-arc-episodes-337-381>Thriller Bark Arc (Episodes 337-381)</h3><p>Thriller Bark stays true to its name by being something of horror storyline. Luffy and the crew become the unwitting victims of a being capable of weaponizing their own shadows against them, trapping them on the remarkably spooky island. They eventually beat the demon, and even get a new crew member, this time being the goofy-go-lucky musician skeleton Brook (<strong>Chō</strong>).</p><h3 id=spa-island-arc-episodes-382-384>Spa Island Arc (Episodes 382-384)</h3><p>After a spooky adventure in the Thriller Bark Arc, the Straw Hat crew take a much needed break on the leisurely Spa Island.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=summit-war-saga>Summit War Saga</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screen-shot-2023-07-16-at-1-53-03-pm.jpg><h3 id=sabaody-archipelago-arc-episodes-385-405>Sabaody Archipelago Arc (Episodes 385-405)</h3><p>As we reach the halfway point of the series, Luffy and the Straw Hat crew have also conquered at least half of the notorious Grand Line. This has not gone unnoticed by the world's bounty hunters and the World Government, who seek to stop Luffy from getting to the New World at any cost. Another foe they've attracted is an old one from their past named Kuma (<strong>Hideyuki Hori</strong>), who kickstarted the new saga by defeating Luffy and sending him to another island.</p><h3 id=amazon-lily-arc-episodes-408-417>Amazon Lily Arc (Episodes 408-417)</h3><p>The other island that Luffy is sent to is Amazon Lily, and it could not be worse place for the pirate captain.

Ace (<strong>Toshio Furukawa</strong>) has been taken prisoner in the Impel Down prison. With the help of some of the allies he made while on Amazon Lily, Luffy tracks down the location of his brother to try and save him.

This includes the tragic death of Ace, leading to a rare moment where the typically cocky Luffy is humbled and scared by the future challenges that he and his crew may face. They take the end of this arc to mourn their losses and plan their next move.</p><h3 id=toriko-crossover-1-episode-492>Toriko Crossover 1 (Episode 492)</h3><p>In an attempt to excite the new anime adaptation of <strong>Toriko</strong>, Shonen-Jump had the idea for a two-part crossover episode.

If you've made it this far, you've officially crossed the halfway point of the One Piece story (as of now). That said, things are only just getting started.

None other than the home of the dreaded Fish-Men - the same species of mutants that Luffy and the crew tangled with during the Arlong Arc.
