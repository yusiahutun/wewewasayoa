The miniseries also follows the leak of Anderson and Lee’s infamous unauthorized sex tape, which was recorded privately during their honeymoon and stolen and released without their consent. In 1997, pornography director Milton Owen Ingley (also known as Michael Morrion) obtained a copy of Anderson and Lee’s sex tape from their home and sold copies from the website <a href=# rel=nofollow>http://www.pamlee.com</a>. After the leak, Anderson and Lee sued ingley and obtained a court injunction ordering him to stop the sales of the video. The couple also sued the video distribution company, Internet Entertainment Group. After a war in court, Anderson and Lee entered into a&nbsp; confidential settlement agreement with Internet Entertainment Group.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2021, Lee—who shares sons Brandon and Dylan with Anderson—gave his stamp of approval to Stan for playing him.&nbsp;“I know Sebastian, he’s playing me. From what he’s told me, really beautiful story,” he said. “I think a lot of people would think it’s one thing, but it’s really about privacy and how things got crazy then. There’s different laws now.” Lee continued, “The story’s actually cool, what actually happened wasn’t. People need to know [what occurred.]”</p><p>James, for her part, revealed in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Porter</a> magazine in 2022 that she tried to contact Anderson about Pam & Tommy but didn’t hear a response. “I was really hopeful that she would be involved. I wish it had been different,” she said. “My sole intention was to take care of the story and to play Pamela authentically.” She continued, “I’ve never worked so hard. I read the books [Anderson] has written, I read her poetry, I can parrot along to all her interviews.” James also told the site that it took her four hours to get into costume for the role, which required her to wear a chest plate, a wig and self tan.&nbsp;“Slowly, our incredible team found a balance where I resembled Pamela but also felt like I could act through it,” she said. “I’ve never done anything where I look very different from myself before. … There was a bravery that came from that. A courage that came from disappearing.”</p><p>Stan also told Variety in 2022 about why he thought Anderson and Lee’s leak was an “important story” to tell.&nbsp;“It’s an important story, I think, from being able to understand what the impact of that media tornado really was,” he said. “For them as a couple but particularly for her as a woman. I can’t imagine what having a private home video stolen from you — how that wouldn’t impact a newlywed couple.”</p><p>To prepare for the role, Stan told the magazine that he watched past interviews with Lee on YouTube, read the drummer’s autobiography, Tommy Land, and consumed Mötley Crüe’s tell-all, “The Dirt: Confessions of the World’s Most Notorious Rock Band.” He also learned how to play the drums and re-create Lee’s signature style. “It’s not easy to do,” Stan says of Stan said of Lee’s famous drumstick twirl.“My fingers were swollen for a good week and a half. I kept hitting myself in the head with it.”</p><p>While Anderson hasn’t been involved in Pam & Tommy, producer Robert Siegel told Variety that the show is a tribute to the model and what she experienced.&nbsp;“The show loves Pam,” he said. “So I hope Pam loves the show. She’s certainly the hero of the show. At every step of the way, we’ve tried to do right by her. From the writing to working very closely with Lily, who kind of grew into our custodian of the character.”&nbsp; James added, “It just made me want to work even harder to try and portray her not only authentically, but to do her the justice she deserves. It’s interesting to me that we are relooking at a lot of those stories from the ’90s through this more modern perspective. It’s the only way we can grow and learn and move forward.”</p><p>So where can one stream Pam & Tommy?
