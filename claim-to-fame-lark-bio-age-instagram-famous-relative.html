In this article, you’ll learn about her famous relative. Moreover, we also cover her age, Instagram, and her job.</p><p>So, keep learning while scrolling down.</p><h3><strong>Meet Lark, One Of The Contestants On Claim To Fame</strong></h3><p>ABC’s Claim To Fame is a one-of-a-kind show where contestants have to guess who their fellow contestants are related to.</p><p>In the&nbsp;Claim to Fame&nbsp;house, clues are hidden everywhere, from the statues and paintings to the Clue Wall, which contains pictures and 3D images of objects having to do with each celebrity relative. At the end of each episode, the contestants vote for which of the bottom two finishers will become the Guesser in the Guess-Off.</p><p>The “guesser” is selected by the contestants themselves and the selected person will choose a “guessee”. If the guesser correctly answers who the guessee’s famous relative is, then, the latter won’t be eligible to move forward in the next episode.</p><p>Otherwise, the guesser who isn’t able to name the famous relative correctly will be the one eliminated from the show.</p><p>Lark is one of the 12 contestants who appeared on the show as someone who has a famous relative. But surprisingly, she has been a low-key figure in the show other contestants and viewers at home have no idea who she is related to. So, who is Lark and who is her famous relative? Let’s explore a few clues and try to unfold the identity of her Claim To Fame.</p><p>Maxwell, the grandson of Chuck Norris, was disqualified for using a cell phone inside the house, and Michael, Zendaya’s cousin whose real name is Cubb Coleman, was also eliminated. Whoopi Goldberg’s granddaughter Amara, <a href=#>Louise</a>, Simone Biles’ sister Adria, and Brittany, Brett Favre’s daughter, are among the participants whose identities have been made public.</p><h3><strong>Claim To Fame Lark Famous Relative</strong></h3><p>The first clue that we have regarding Lark’s famous relative is she has a famous aunt. Lark hasn’t received much attention so far in Claim to Fame season 1. No one is really sure how she might be linked, and she hasn’t been seen taking part in much of the drama in the house.</p><p>When Brittany won the Claim to Fame talent show challenge in that same episode, she choose to get a clue about Lark as her reward, which was a crossword puzzle that read “Runway Queen of the ’80s.” Although the audience was given the solution, Brittany was unable to understand the hint.</p><p>Distractify has now discovered information that might establish to who 1980s supermodel Lark is linked. Lark is allegedly linked to legendary supermodel Cindy Crawford, the outlet reveals. The first hint is that Lark, whose full name is Lark Skov, is followed on Instagram by Kaia Gerber, Cindy’s daughter, according to a fan named Rosalie on Twitter. The second hint comes from a Daily Mail piece from 2014 that features a picture of Lark and names her Cindy’s niece.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Claim-To-Fame-Lark-Bio-Age-Instagram-Famous-Relative-300x220.jpg><p>Lark is seen in the image dressed as Cindy for Halloween.</p><p>These two clues certainly reveal that Claim to Fame Kark’s famous aunt is Cindy Crawford. But, we have to wait and see which contestant will be able to figure out her real identity in the show.</p><p>Other speculations about Lark’s true identity include her comparison to Lorde.</p><h3><strong>Claim To Fame Lark Age</strong></h3><p>The date of birth of Claim To Fame Lark is 23 March 1998. So as of July 2022, she is 24 years old.</p><h3><strong>What Is Claim To Fame Lark Last Name?</strong></h3><p>The last name of Claim To Fame Lark is Skov. Her full name is Larkspur Eileen Skov. Lark is the daughter of Danielle Skov (Crawford) and Michael Storey Skov.</p><p>Her father is a Business & Contract Development Director at ESI. Previously, he served as the Vice President of Casey Industrial. He holds a BS in communication studies from Northwestern University. He completed MA in Latin American studies from the University of Chicago.</p><h3><strong>Claim To Fame Lark Job</strong></h3><p>Claim To Fame Lark has de-functed her LinkedIn profile. But, she was working as a legal assistant at Northwest Consumer Law Center. She joined the company in January 2022. They welcomed her via Facebook and Twitter posts.</p><p>According to the Twitter post, Lark graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in Linguistics and is now in the process of applying to law school. She completed high school at Steamboat Springs High School in 2016. While at the University of Washington, she has become a member of the 2019 NCAA national championship rowing team.</p><p>Lark was also invited to the 2019 U.S. Rowing U-23 National Team Selection Camp, which will determine the athletes who will compete in the World Championships in Ottensheim, Austria, in the summer of 2019. Growing up, she spent most of her time on cross-country skis and snow as a member of the Steamboat Springs Winter Sports Club’s Nordic program. She stopped skiing her junior year, but her need to compete kept driving her.</p><p>After a year away from Nordic skiing, Lark received little interest from colleges to pursue that sport, so she decided the train through the summer. Her performance on an ergometer was enough to get the attention of the coaches at the University of Washington where she was already planning to attend college.</p><p>Lark won a bronze medal in the U.S. women’s eight at the 2019 World Rowing Under 23 Championships.
