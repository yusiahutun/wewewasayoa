For a parent, that alone is unimaginable. But what really happened to Shaniya is far worse, and according to <a href=#>CBS News</a>, Shaniya’s mother, Antoinette, was at the center of it all.</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=606 data-injectable=true>After five-year-old Shaniya purportedly disappeared, police immediately suspected foul play. Their fears were confirmed when surveillance video surfaced from a North Carolina hotel showing a man carrying the young girl through the lobby. This was not her abductor, however. Instead, Shaniya’s mother sold her into sex work.</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>Hopes that Shaniya may yet be alive were dashed when her dead body was uncovered near Fayetteville. By that point, her mother, Antoinette had been arrested for sex trafficking. But to whom did she sell her daughter? And how did the young girl die? Within a matter of weeks, those questions and more would be answered.</p><h2 id=h-mario-andrette-mcneill-was-arrested data-injectable=false>Mario Andrette McNeill was arrested</h2><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=703 data-injectable=true>Not long after Shaniya Davis’ body was recovered, Mario Andretti McNeill was taken into custody and charged with her murder. It was determined Shaniya had been raped and strangled. What motivated Shaniya’s mother, Antoinette Davis, to do the unthinkable — offer her own daughter up for sex work — was a simple drug debt of just $200, <a href=#>The Fayetteville Observer</a> reported.</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>As the investigation revealed, McNeill had been previously involved with Antoinette’s sister. Around the time Shaniya disappeared, McNeill was under the influence of substances when early one morning he entered the Davis’ home. That same morning, Antoinette reported her daughter missing, but at first she claimed she didn’t know what had happened to her.</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>After falsely accusing her boyfriend, Antoinette admitted she offered sex with her daughter to pay back money, not to kill her. As of 2019, Antoinette was serving at least 17 1/2 years, while McNeill was on death row.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Further controversy</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=658 data-injectable=true>The death of a child who had been sold into sex work by her own mother is terrible enough, but an even darker side to the Shaniya Davis story is that both North Carolina law enforcement and local social services made several missteps in the weeks and months leading up to her murder and assault. If things had gone differently, Shaniya might still be alive.</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>According to the <a href=#>Winston-Salem Journal</a>, for example, local authorities failed to communicate signs of abuse to one another. By 2017, new procedures and rule were established in the area to help address shortcomings in how Shaniya’s situation was handled, and to hopefully better protect children going forward</p><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true>Sadly, Shaniya had only just recently gone to live with her mother. Per The Fayetteville-Observer, Shaniya’s father, Bradley Lockhart, had hoped Antoinette could finally be a mother to Shaniya. Prior to that point, “[Antoinette] was never part of her life,” Lockhart said.</p><p data-characters=131 data-current-count=131 data-injectable=false>If you know someone suffering from sexual violence, contact <a href=#>RAINN</a> or the National Sexual Abuse Telephone Hotline at 1-800-656-4673.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9ahmK1lmah6tbTEZqqtp6KuerCyjKyfmqaZrq5usMCvoKxlp528brXSZqqhnV2Wu6V51qGYrWWYlr2xsc2em2asn2K1pr6O</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-the-story-of-shaniya-davis-who-is-she-and-what-happened-to-her.html&text=What%20is%20the%20story%20of%20Shaniya%20Davis%3f%20Who%20is%20she%2c%20and%20what%20happened%20to%20her%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-the-story-of-shaniya-davis-who-is-she-and-what-happened-to-her.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-the-story-of-shaniya-davis-who-is-she-and-what-happened-to-her.html&title=What%20is%20the%20story%20of%20Shaniya%20Davis%3f%20Who%20is%20she%2c%20and%20what%20happened%20to%20her%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-is-the-story-of-shaniya-davis-who-is-she-and-what-happened-to-her.html&title=What%20is%20the%20story%20of%20Shaniya%20Davis%3f%20Who%20is%20she%2c%20and%20what%20happened%20to%20her%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-the-story-of-shaniya-davis-who-is-she-and-what-happened-to-her.html&title=What%20is%20the%20story%20of%20Shaniya%20Davis%3f%20Who%20is%20she%2c%20and%20what%20happened%20to%20her%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-the-story-of-shaniya-davis-who-is-she-and-what-happened-to-her.html&description=What%20is%20the%20story%20of%20Shaniya%20Davis%3f%20Who%20is%20she%2c%20and%20what%20happened%20to%20her%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./41-year-olds-body-pulled-from-river-in-niskayuna.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="41-Year-Old's Body Pulled From River In Niskayuna">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./message-boards.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sonnys nephew? - General Hospital">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
