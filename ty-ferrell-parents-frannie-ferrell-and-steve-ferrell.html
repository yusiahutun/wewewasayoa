He is starring as the cast member of the new season of Farmer Wants A Wife which follows four gorgeous guys as they look for their next great love. The FOX show, hosted by Jennifer Nettles, returned on Thursday, February 8, 2024, with 32 single women, eight of whom Ty met and decided whether or not to trade their city lifestyle for his country lifestyle.</p><p>Scroll down and read all about Ty’s folks.</p><h3><strong>Farmer Wants A Wife: Who Are Ty Ferrell Parents?</strong></h3><p>Steve Ferrell and Frannie Ferrell are the parents of Farmer Wants A Wife singleton Ty Ferrell who welcomed him to the world as Steven Tyler Ferrell.

However, this is not Ty’s first foray into reality television.</p><p>Ty and his ex-wife Sarah shot a home DIY show pilot in 2014. Then-couple recorded the episode alongside Ty’s mother, to repurpose rescued items from other projects through their family’s company, Ferrell Excavation. It doesn’t appear that the show ever got off, but Sarah did go on to film something else without Ty.</p><p>Sarah was approached in 2016 to co-host the FIY home renovation show He Shed She Shed alongside Luke Barr. The show only lasted one season, and Sarah appears to have attempted to stay out of the spotlight as much as possible since then.</p><h3><strong>Meet Frannie Ferrell, Ty Ferrell Mother</strong></h3><p>Frannie Ferrell is the mother of Ty Ferrell.
