Consider the MIT-educated Ph.D. scientists that created a micro-mist device that allows ingredients to penetrate 20 times deeper or the ingenious device that accomplishes eight+ tasks in a single handheld tool. Or maybe you’re old school — no problem! There’s more scientific proof than ever that tried-and-true tools, like facial massagers and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>gua sha</a>, have face-altering benefits.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But no matter your goal, there’s likely a tool that can accomplish it, according to Dr. Hardik Doshi, a double board certified facial plastic surgeon in Long Island, New York, who says that: “There is some evidence to suggest that at-home facial devices can be effective in improving the appearance of the skin.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-therabody-theraface-pro></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Therabody TheraFace Pro</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Therabody TheraFace Pro" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ADywWmuO60F23BzeEFUoumyPvhw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/theraface-pro-d7f624620ecd466ba20ffdc6f010af7d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Therabody</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This single tool addresses at least eight different skin concerns, including de-puffing, releasing muscle tension and firming skin.<br><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The hot and cold ring attachments are sold separately.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Kristyn Smith, aesthetician and founder of Practise NYC, counts Bella Hadid (among many, many more fresh-faced models and celebrities) as a regular client. Smith has access to every device on the market, both new and old, and her recommendation for the must-have at-home tool is the TheraFace.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s heralded as an all-in-one device, but truly, it’s an eight-in-one solution, courtesy of the various attachments that harness several different energy and physical therapies into one single instrument. A kit includes three percussive attachments, one microcurrent ring, three LED rings (red light for fine lines, blue for acne, and infrared to target deep skin and wrinkles), and one cleansing ring. You can also purchase hot and cold ring add-ons.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“It has several different modalities that target some of the facial issues that I think have become more prominent since the pandemic,” she says, including increased facial tension, which she says is not only uncomfortable, but it can also have a huge impact on the face over time. Yet, the TheraFace’s percussive therapy — aka rapid and repetitive vibrating pressure —&nbsp; takes the guesswork out of an at-home facial and neck massage; all you have to do is hold the device against your skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To tighten or lift your visage, simply swap the percussive therapy heads for the microcurrent attachment and get to work stimulating your facial muscles, which then, in turn, increases collagen synthesis within the skin, says Smith.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type of Tool:</strong> Microcurrent, LED, cleansing | <strong>Good for: </strong>Sculpting, tension relief, brightening<strong> </strong>| <strong>Usage:</strong> Daily or weekly (depending on attachment)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-solawave-4-in-1-skincare-wand-with-red-light-therapy></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Solawave 4-in-1 Skincare Wand with Red Light Therapy</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ulta Solawave 4-in-1 Skincare Wand with Red Light Therapy" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/mqHjucfEHqlE92PxHqwfA6-uZ4c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Solawave-4-in-1-Skincare-Wand-with-Red-Light-Therapy-06f3053bea4940bd8210da8706ece7a6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> Its travel-friendly size and budget-conscious price make it a great beginner’s tool.<br><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The results can be subtle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This four-in-one wand features four distinct settings designed to support the skin all within one small, handheld tool that weighs less than an ounce: Red light, low-level microcurrent, low-vibration facial massage, and therapeutic warmth. Not only can it help with facial tone, fine lines, puffiness, and redness, but it gets the job done with only five minutes of your time each day, three days a week.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s also great before a big night out, as shown by Meghann Fahy at the 2023 Screen Actors Guild Awards. Makeup artist Emily Cheng used this wand over her entire face, spending extra time on smile lines. “Also, it's great to calm any inflammation or spots on the face prior to makeup,” says Cheng.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type of Tool:</strong> Microcurrent, LED, facial massage | <strong>Good for: </strong>Fine lines, puffiness, redness <strong>&nbsp;</strong>| <strong>Usage:</strong> 3x per week</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-anti-aging-droplette-micro-infuser></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Anti-Aging</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Droplette Micro-Infuser</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=Droplette style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/iYYaKFjBE1xWtXazvDta11ku5cY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/aa-89a7b476701e406c93b5fdf43b8a459e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Droplette</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This first-of-its-kind tool can get topical skincare to penetrate 20 times deeper into the skin.<br><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The device works only with its own capsules.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Droplette is what happens when two MIT-educated Ph.D. scientists accidentally stumble upon the skincare benefits of micro-mist ingredients while researching how to treat debilitating skin diseases. Throw in a patent and a grant from NASA and you’ve got the Micro-Infuser.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The science behind the Droplette is based on aerosolizing ingredients into a micro-mist, which allows products to penetrate 20 times deeper than a standard topical application, making it 90 percent more effective than other products. If it sounds kind of nuts, take a look at their impressive <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">clinical studies</a> that back it up.

A facial cleansing brush can alleviate skin congestion, clogged pores, and flare-ups by gently exfoliating the skin, and removing dirt, oil, and makeup that can clog pores and contribute to breakouts, says Dr. Doshi.&nbsp;As a second step in an acne-fighting routine, Dr. Doshi recommends a blue light therapy device. The wavelengths from blue light kill acne-causing bacteria on the skin’s surface.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Hyperpigmentation: </strong>Discoloration can be a difficult condition to self-treat, but there are a few devices that can help. According to Dr. Doshi, a microcurrent device can help to improve skin texture and reduce the appearance of pigmentation. Additionally, speeding up circulation with a manual device, like a massage tool or gua sha can reduce inflammation, which is a common trigger for hyperpigmentation.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Fine lines and wrinkles :</strong>While you might feel tempted to grab the most super-charged device you can find to address the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, a manual facial massage tool can work wonders too, says Dr. Doshi. “A facial massage tool can be used to gently massage the skin,” he says. “This can help to improve circulation and promote lymphatic drainage, reducing puffiness, and improving the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.”<br></li></ul><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Type of Tool</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The world of facial tools and devices is varied and expansive, but here are the most popular categories.</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>LED:</strong> Light Emitting Diodes use different wavelengths of light to target various skin concerns, explains Dr. Doshi.
