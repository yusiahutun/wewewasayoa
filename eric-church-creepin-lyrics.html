For whatever reason, I was a little hungover. I had a little bit of a headache," Church tells Taste of Country of how the song came to be. "It wasn't bad. It wasn't like a five-alarm hangover thing, but I was a little bit hungover. I had my guitar, and I was on the screened in porch. It was in the spring, and there was this honeybee that kept beatin' its head on the screen, over and over and over. I remember thinking, 'My head probably feels like that honeybee's head.' That's where [the opening lines started]."</p><p>"Bom, bom, bom, bom-oh /&nbsp;Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom-oh /&nbsp;Like a honey bee beatin' on my screen door / I got a little buzz and my head is sore," Churck sketched out in the opening verse to 'Creepin'.'</p><p>"I didn't have a title," the singer says. "I didn't have anything. I kind of just kept playing it, and suddenly I just said, 'Creepin'.' I thought it was odd and it was stupid... what's creepin'? It was weird, though, and I loved the weirdness. I had the boms too ... I was doing the bom bom ... the walk down thing."</p><p>"The next day I was writing with Marv Green, and I went in and told him the story," Church continues. "I said, 'This is probably the dumbest thing you'll ever hear, but...' and I played it for him, what I had. He loved it. He immediately came in, and I credit Marv with the chorus and starting to tie together the storyline. He came in and started developing what came from me sitting on my porch hungover."</p><p>"Head for the future run from the past / Hide from the mirror and live in a glass /&nbsp;What dreams forget the whiskey remembers /&nbsp;Kinda like molasses in late December just a creepin' /&nbsp;Creepin', oh creep," they wrote in the 'Creepin'' chorus.</p><p>"The great thing about it is in the end, because the song started out so far out there, that there really was nowhere we couldn't go," notes Church. "We were able to cross the song and go anywhere with it. I think with lines like 'Cocaine kiss / Caffeine love,' came from. We weren't worried about boundaries at that point in time. We were able to write it however we wanted to write it. It really freed us up and allowed the process to really start flowing."</p><p>"Your cocaine kiss and caffeine love / Got under my skin and into my blood /&nbsp;That need ya back comes over me / Like ivy crawlin' up a hickory tree just a creepin' /&nbsp;Creepin', just a creep, creep / Creepin'," they wrote in the 'Creepin'' lyrics.</p><p>"The track does creep in and creep out," Church explains of the song that kicks off his 'Chief' album. "I do like that. It kind of brings you in before it starts punching. It starts out kind of soft and swampy, then by the time you get to the chorus, it's hammering you pretty good. Then it kind of creeps out that way. I like the way, not only is the title 'Creepin',' but it does actually creep in and creep out."</p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Listen to Eric Church, 'Creepin''</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnqqZmHqktNSrmqFlk6eyprzIp2SlsaKesLR7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feric-church-creepin-lyrics.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2feric-church-creepin-lyrics.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2feric-church-creepin-lyrics.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2feric-church-creepin-lyrics.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feric-church-creepin-lyrics.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2feric-church-creepin-lyrics.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./rapper-is-bktherula-gay-everything-on-her-age-real-name-wiki.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./rapper-is-bktherula-gay-everything-on-her-age-real-name-wiki.html>Rapper: Is Bktherula Gay?
