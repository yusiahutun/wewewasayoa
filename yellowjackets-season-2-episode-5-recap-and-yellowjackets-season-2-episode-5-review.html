They both express a desire to work through their issues, but it remains to be seen if they can overcome their differences.</span></span></span></p><p class="-Zro6 -ZADH IjV6v AnCKd _57WYp" id=viewer-a1l9915000><span class=d0767><span><span>Meanwhile, Danny is still struggling with the aftermath of Amy's revenge prank, as he tries to remove the white paint from his truck.

Veronica and Edwin make him feel comfortable and encourage him to come back. He also discusses getting a loan with someone from the bank, but is told his credit score and inconsistent income will prevent him from getting one. He considers using his church to secure a plan and discusses it with Pastor Kim.</span></span></span></p><p class="-Zro6 -ZADH IjV6v AnCKd _57WYp" id=viewer-viubj15815><span class=d0767><span><span>Jordana, the business executive who has shown interest in buying Amy's business, shows up at Amy's house with a term sheet that requires her to stay on for five more years.

George masturbates to Mia's photo, while Danny expresses his feelings through a song at the church. Paul comes clean to Amy about his misunderstanding of Kayla and kisses her, further complicating their relationship.</span></span></span></p></span><p class="-Zro6 -ZADH IjV6v AnCKd _57WYp" id=viewer-lpv8016036><span class=d0767><span><span>Overall, "I am inhabited by a cry" is a complex and emotionally resonant episode, exploring the characters' vulnerabilities and struggles with intimacy, communication, and self-worth.

The plot developments are gripping and leave the audience on the edge of their seats, as they try to anticipate what will happen next.</span></span></span></p><p class="-Zro6 -ZADH IjV6v AnCKd _57WYp" id=viewer-esgf516329><span class=d0767><span><span>The acting performances remain strong, particularly from Jai Courtney, who delivers a compelling performance as Simon, the central character of the series.
