He was raised in Manchester, New Hampshire after his parents moved their family there when he was only six years old.</span></p><p><span>Adam attended school at Manchester Central High and graduated from New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts in 1988.&nbsp;One of the earliest acting credits Adam Sandler played was as Theo Huxtable’s friend Smitty in the staple role on&nbsp;</span><span>The Cosby Show</span><span>&nbsp;in 1987.</span></p><p><span>His film debut came in 1989 when he appeared in&nbsp;</span><span>Going Overboard</span><span>&nbsp;while continuing to perform at comedy clubs.&nbsp;He had been touring comedy clubs since he was 17 when his brother talked him into trying it.&nbsp;Ultimately, Adam was discovered by Dennis Miller, who made a name for himself in Los Angeles and recommended him to the then Saturday Night Live producer.&nbsp;This led to Adam Sandler’s hiring as a writer for Saturday Night Live in 1990. However, he soon became a standout performer, singing mostly funny original music on the show.&nbsp;He told The Tonight Show that NBC fired him from Saturday Night Live in 1995.</span></p><span>He went on to make comedy film after comedy film before finally getting a more serious role in&nbsp;</span><span>Blow Drunk Love</span><span>&nbsp;. In 2002, he was nominated for a Golden Globe.&nbsp;In June 2010, Adam Sandler was invited to collaborate on the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, where&nbsp;</span><span>Hit Drunk Love</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Funny People</span><span>&nbsp;listed as examples of his work.</span><p><span>Sandler founded his own film production company in 1999 called Happy Madison Productions.&nbsp;Underneath, the actor/comedian has produced most of his subsequent projects and although the films have received negative reviews, most of them have performed well at the box office.&nbsp;In 2014, Adam Sandler and Happy Madison signed a four-movie deal with Netflix.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Adam Sandler Net Worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>The Hollywood star is a very rich man.&nbsp;His efforts in the film industry have paid off as he is said to be worth an estimated $340 million.&nbsp;In 2015 alone, he was able to rake in $41 million to establish himself as one of the biggest comedic film superstars.&nbsp;His deal with Netflix also made him a ton of money.</span></p><h2><strong><span>His wife and children</span></strong></h2><p><span>On June 22, 2003, Adam Sandler married Jacqueline Titone (Jackie Sandler), who has since converted to his religion of Judaism.&nbsp;She is a regular face in most of her husband’s Happy Madison productions.&nbsp;Together they have two daughters;&nbsp;Sadie who was born in 2006 and Sunny who was born in 2008.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height and other facts you need to know</span></strong></h2><p><span>1. Adam Sandler is 177 cm tall and weighs 86 kg.&nbsp;He has a chubby look that fits in with the characters he portrays in films.</span></p><p><span>2. He’s a funny guy in all of his films, so doesn’t necessarily need the dashing looks and spectacular body of a “serious” main character.</span></p><p><span>3. Adam Sandler describes Judaism as his religion.</span></p><p><span>4. He has not disclosed his political views except for some donations that went to Rudy Giuliani’s presidential campaign.&nbsp;Rudy is a Republican and former New York Mayor.</span></p><p><span>5. His first studio album is called&nbsp;</span><span>They’ll All Laugh at You!&nbsp;</span><span>was released by Warner Bros in 1993 and was certified 2x platinum.</span></p><p><span>6. Adam’s parents, Judith “Judy” Levine and Stanley Sandler, were both Russian immigrants.</span></p><p><span>7. He seems to be very fond of dogs and has three names: Motzaball, Meatball and Babu.</span></p><p><span>8. Adams and his wife were both born in September.&nbsp;Despite this, he is 8 years older than her, since she was born exactly on September 24 and in 1974.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><span class=vce-square></span><h2 class=entry-title><a href=# title="Jynxzi’s age, height, real name, net worth, girlfriend, All to know about Junko">Jynxzi’s age, height, real name, net worth, girlfriend, All to know about Junko</a></h2><span class=vce-square></span><h2 class=entry-title><a href=# title="Who is Freddie Highmore’s wife?
